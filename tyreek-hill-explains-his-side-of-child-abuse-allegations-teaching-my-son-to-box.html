If you'll recall, Hill was accused of assaulting his child by his own baby mother, allegations he continues to deny. Upon coming to grips with the possible ramifications, the NFL put the Chiefs' wideout on its inactive list, barring him from competition until now.

That would probably refer to me teaching my son how to box. 'Cause we do got boxing gloves at our house," Tyreek Hill explained at a press conference held this afternoon.

It appears as though Hill has the support of his teammates going into next season.
