With a trip to Ibiza, a family holiday and a destination wedding in Greece to dress for, I pledged to only dress in pre-loved clothes in a bid to prove that sustainable fashion is so much more than just dull and drab hand-me-downs.&nbsp;</p><p id=eUJN8RA3-P data-wc=22></p><h2>Inside my sustainable holiday style file</h2><p id=eMHjhvm2CN data-wc=64>Despite my penchant for sustainable fashion, I'll be the first to claim that <a class=hm-link href=#>rental fashion</a> isn't quite there yet when it comes to being entirely affordable. While platforms like <a class=hm-link href=#>Hirestreet</a> do offer more accessible prices, with rentals starting from just £20, most high-end hires are reserved exclusively for the style elite who can afford to spend upwards of £100 for a four-day dress loan.&nbsp;</p><p id=eVPUpsWzvO data-wc=28><strong>My hack to unlock rental fashion for free?</strong> Borrow clothes from your friends and family. The most sustainable wardrobe is the one you (or your friends) already own.</p><h3>The borrowed beach dresses</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c687d708f82f-georgia-cala-gracioneta-ibiza.jpg><p id=e4GoRAmdVUW data-wc=23>&nbsp;I loaned this stunning linen maxi dress from my former flatmate Alyx, and teamed it with golden starfish earrings from another friend, Olivia.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/50104e638bc5-georgia-dress.jpg><p id=e6m3Rvc4QH data-wc=49>This psychedelic sheer dress complete with a ruffled hem and romantic fluted sleeves was the perfect fit to hit up Destino, a lavish poolside resort in Ibiza where the style set go to see and be seen. I borrowed it from Emma, another effortlessly stylish sister in my life.</p><h3>The charity shop wedding guest gown</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ccb5eb52d8e4-georgia-wedding-guest-dress.jpg><p id=eQjYTFaemB data-wc=62>It was my lucky day when I sourced this ombré halterneck maxi dress in a <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>British Red Cross</a> charity shop for £15. Brand new from Zara, with the tags still in tact when I bought it, this second-hand steal will long be one of my favourite sustainable finds - and it would have cost over £100 if bought on the high street.&nbsp;</p><p id=e0n8trUrt2 data-wc=43>Zara's ongoing partnership with British Red Cross not only sees garments being recycled into new fabrics, but also gives past season clothes another chance at avoiding landfill. Most clothes I have found here are brand new, sold for a fraction of the price.</p><h3>The pre-loved bargain skirt</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3434b6c26a43-orange-skirt.jpg><p id=eciB7A_D3H data-wc=29>I have lived in this silky orange skirt all summer. Easy, breezy, and in a fabulous tangerine hue, this archival Topshop find was just £4 in a charity shop.&nbsp;</p><h3>The Vinted cowboy boots</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/eb5e7edac23a-silver-cowboy-boots.jpg><p id=eWdRUq34Pb data-wc=65><a class=hm-link href=#>My ongoing love affair with Vinted</a> is well documented. Not only have I made over £1000 on the fashion resale platform, but many of my clothes and accessories are bought on the app. Personally, I have found that the low prices on Vinted are unmatched. If you have the patience to search for exactly what you're looking for, you can often find an affordable treasure.&nbsp;</p><p id=ewKfvXxYTO data-wc=23>These pre-loved silver cowboy boots had me stomping around Ibiza like it was nobody's business. I picked them up on <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Vinted</a> for £11!</p><h3>The Oxfam mini dress</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b92470a5b8b6-white-dress.jpg><p id=etljlKHacS data-wc=34>Another favourite pre-loved fashion find of mine this summer has to be this puff-sleeved corset style mini dress. Reminiscent of House of CB's iconic 'Florianne' dress, this dreamy white number was sourced from <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Oxfam</a>.</p><h3>The upcycled gingham gown</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/431ab4fa0fca-gingham-mini-dress.jpg><p id=erzqHgh3Ev data-wc=39>When I picked up this ruffled gingham wrap dress in Oxfam last summer, it needed a button replacing and its hemline restitched. So often we throw clothes away rather than putting in time and minimal effort into repairing them.&nbsp;</p><p id=e-L09FVlo- data-wc=43>In less than half an hour I had given it a new lease of life, and it's become one of my most-worn summer looks. Here, I styled it with a vintage head scarf I picked up from a thrift store in downtown Seville.&nbsp;</p><h2>What is sustainable fashion?</h2><p id=epx91GvDvN data-wc=62>Sustainable fashion refers to the way in which brands source their materials to reduce their impact on the planet and support their garment workers. There are endless ways you can adopt a more ethical and environmental approach to fashion, such as investing in pre-loved fashion, buying less but better garments, renting clothes instead of buying new and styling items you already own.</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">MORE RESOURCES</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="I'm a Homes Editor and here are the sustainable cleaning hacks I swear by" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/8b1a856da044-sustainable-cleaning-hacks.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="I'm a Homes Editor and here are the sustainable cleaning hacks I swear by" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>I'm a Homes Editor and here are the sustainable cleaning hacks I swear by</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="How to make your clothes last forever, according to an expert" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/359ee0d76394-d0fjre.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="How to make your clothes last forever, according to an expert" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>How to make your clothes last forever, according to an expert</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Thrifting pre-loved furniture can save you £1000s on your home - here's how to do it" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/b38d5f9151b3-steph-wilson-1lyawq5ovss-unsplash.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Thrifting pre-loved furniture can save you £1000s on your home - here's how to do it" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Thrifting pre-loved furniture can save you £1000s on your home - here's how to do it</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
