Volunteers and police embarked on a search, leading to a distressing discovery the next day. Karen was found brutally beaten on the side of the road, her life hanging in the balance. Rushed to the hospital, she slipped into a coma, the aftermath of a heinous attack that left the community in shock.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3><strong>The Pursuit of Justice Begins</strong></h3><p>Police swiftly identified the assailant, Lukah Chang, also known as Danny Woo, through CCTV footage. The weapon, a metal pipe, was discovered near the crime scene. Lukah was promptly apprehended, and the investigation revealed a chilling connection to a previous murder. Lukah openly confessed to his crimes, stating that he took a life to experience the act. In 2014, he was sentenced to 35 years to life for the murder of Amyjane Brandhagen and the attempted murder of Karen Lange.</p><h3><strong>Karen Lange’s Resilience</strong></h3><p>In a 2013 interview with KEPR, Karen shared her sentiments: “At first I didn’t want to, but sitting here and looking around—it feels more like a win since I wasn’t beaten by the whole incident. I was happy to hear that Lukah was found guilty.” Despite enduring extensive rehabilitation, surgeries, and medical procedures, Karen faced severe memory loss and tracheal damage.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3><strong>Rebuilding a Life</strong></h3><p>Karen’s determination to recover was unwavering, supported by her loved ones.
