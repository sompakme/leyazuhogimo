He went on to create fan-favorite recurring character <a href=#>Chad</a>, known for being an affable, lovable doofus, but it wasn't long before Davidson's off-camera persona threatened to overtake his comedic one. Davidson kicked up a whirlwind romance with pint-sized pop star Ariana Grande in 2018, dominating the tabloids as the couple walked around New York together, Grande staring lovingly up at her boyfriend while sucking on a lollipop.</p><p>She even told the world about Davidson's, uh, "BDE," sparking a cultural movement (via <a href=#>The Cut</a>).&nbsp;Their relationship was not to last, but he quickly rebounded, staying in the press thanks to <a href=#>high-profile hookups like Kate Bosworth and a certain someone named Kim Kardashian</a>. He also became a bona-fide movie star, acting in films like Judd Apatow's "The King of Staten Island" and "The Suicide Squad."</p><p>That brings us to Davidson's appearance in "Bodies Bodies Bodies,"&nbsp;where he plays into his status as an unlikely sex symbol as David, the boyfriend of Chase Sui Wonders' character Emma. In the film's <a href=#>trailer</a>, Davidson deadpans, "I just look like I&nbsp;f***, you know what I mean? I look like I f***, and that's the vibe I like to put out there."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcmxpbX54e8eeqZ6rXay1pr7EZrCorV2gu7DDjK2fnmWTlsC1ec6fZJunlJ6ytHnBqJuinaNir7CwyJ6qZp6ipLpw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./cartel-crew-season-4-cast-trailer-release-date-spoilers-and-where-to-watch.html><span>←</span><span>Cartel Crew Season 4 Cast, Trailer, Release Date, Spoilers and Where to Watch</span></a>
