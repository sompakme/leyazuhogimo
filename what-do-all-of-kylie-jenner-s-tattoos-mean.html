At least, that seems to be <a href=#>Kylie Jenner's</a> philosophy. While Jenner can certainly be said to march to the beat of her own drum (anyone else remember when <a href=#>she co-wrote that dystopian sci-fi novel with big-sister Kendall</a>?), a few of her tattoos aren't unique — because they're shared with someone else.</p><p>For instance, back in 2017, <a href=#>UsWeekly</a> reported that Jenner and boyfriend Travis Scott got matching butterfly tattoos. Jenner's is located just above her ankle on the back of her right leg, while Scott's is in the same spot on his left leg. The general opinion seems to be that the butterflies are in reference to Scott's single "<a href=#>Butterfly Effect.</a>"</p><p>In May 2019, <a href=#>Page Six</a> reported that Kylie Jenner got her <a href=#>daughter Stormi's</a> name tattooed on the back of her arm at Scott's over-the-top birthday party (where tattoo artist <a href=#>JonBoy</a> was present). Jenner's friend Anastasia Karanikolaou got a Stormi tattoo over her very own, too — in fact, <a href=#>JonBoy uploaded a picture of Karanikolaou's ink to his Instagram page</a> before Jenner revealed her own matching tattoo in an Instagram story.</p><p>Finally, Jenner and former best friend Jordyn Woods got matching tattoos on their pinkies — they're lowercase letter M's in red ink. Obviously, this was well before their friendship came to an end when Woods <a href=#>allegedly had an affair with Tristan Thompson</a>, former boyfriend and father of sister Kourtney Kardashian's daughter True. Tattoos may be forever, but friendship doesn't always stand the test of time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmam5oa4R1e9ahmK1llKR6orjLZqafZZuuuaqxjKOcp6aVp8BuwMCtq6ino2K6pq3NaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./wayne-mardle-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html><span>←</span><span>Wayne Mardle Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</span></a>
