Kendrick isn't active on social media, and he has never played those kinds of games throughout his career. Consequently, fans aren't all that surprised by his silence. That said, fans have wanted to hear from Whitney. After all, she is the one who could definitely put an end to all of the allegations. On Sunday, Whitney was celebrating Mother's Day and her birthday. This led a post on her Instagram story, although it wasn't what fans were waiting for.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-kendrick-lamar-amp-whitney-alford-are-caught-in-some-drama>Kendrick Lamar & Whitney Alford Are Caught In Some Drama</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Instead, you can see that Alford was engaging in some pottery. Fans also noticed that the studio she was doing this at is located in Los Angeles, which is definitely interesting given the statements that have been made lately. As for the caption, Alford wrote "Happy birthday to me. Happy Mother's Day to all my real ones." Needless to say, she seems unbothered given all that is being said about her and her family.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Let us know what you think about the Drake and Kendrick Lamar beef, in the comments section down below.
