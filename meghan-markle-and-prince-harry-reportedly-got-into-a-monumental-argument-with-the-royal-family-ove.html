In the book, Bower describes how the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's final days as full-time royals played out following their decision to depart.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"​​A monumental argument blew up after Harry was told that he and Meghan could not join the family's procession through Westminster Abbey for the annual Commonwealth Day Service," Bower wrote. "Although the order of service listed Harry and Meghan walking behind the Queen, Palace officials had revised their decision. Suspicious about the Sussexes, they decided to publicly humiliate them."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He continued, "Harry was told that having stepped down from royal duties, he and Meghan would sit and wait with the congregation. The prospect of the televised image of their isolation in the Abbey appalled them."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Tom then revealed that although <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Kate Middleton</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Prince William</a> were reportedly not happy with the Sussexes' decision at the time, they decided to join them in the congregation to avoid further arguments.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Eventually, to end the dispute, William and Kate agreed they too would wait with Harry and Meghan," Bower shared. "As the members of the royal family filed into the abbey, the frayed relationships could not be concealed. Kate had blanked the Sussexes and William's greeting was cold. Harry looked strained. Meghan's face showed bemusement."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wp6jnpqinsG6e8yenqGZnmK6or7KpZxopZWctaK6jKaYq6Ocmnqxvsinmp5lmJa%2Fs8WMpqanrZ2au7Wty2adop%2BYqXqzu9iao2aekaK2rcU%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kim-kardashian-and-pete-davidson-just-kissed-in-her-latest-instagram-video.html><span>←</span><span>Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson Just Kissed In Her Latest Instagram Video</span></a>
