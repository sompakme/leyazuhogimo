Now that he's been partnered with the alcohol brand for over a year, he felt like sharing the same video and offering some additional thoughts on who might actually be better than him.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Tunechi surely knows that he's possibly the best rapper alive but he decided to show some love to another artist who could legitimately hold that crown: <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Jay-Z</a>. Asking his loyal following who their favourite rapper of all time is, he came clean on his own pick, revealing that Hov is on top of everybody else. As you would expect, the comments section is full of fans reminding Weezy that he's the best. Honourable mentions include Tupac, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Ice Cube</a>, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Nas</a>, The Notorious B.I.G, and others in the comments.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdhbIB1gpFmo6KkXayuurrEZqmerpWWubR5x6KqZqiZmLhuss6rZK2glWK0sK3TZpinnF2ewbR5zairZqCZosCmuMVmpZ6vow%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kate-middleton-and-prince-william-s-epic-gym-with-1880-joining-fee-revealed-see-inside.html><span>←</span><span>Kate Middleton and Prince William's epic gym with 1880 joining fee revealed see inside</span></a>
