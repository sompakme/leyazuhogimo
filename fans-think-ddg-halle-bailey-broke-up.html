It was just over a year ago when the pair were rumored to have vacationed together. Soon, they were displaying their love to the public, and while it seemed like an unlikely match, their bond quickly grew on fans. However, things seem to have changed online, and people have speculated as to the status of their relationship.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The rapper recently tweeted, "All these girls the same." He dropped off a crying emoji and added, "Ain't no wayy." Then, people noticed that <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>DDG</a> scrubbed his Instagram clean of memories with Bailey. Further, it looked like they no longer follow one another on Instagram, either. It didn't take long for social media users to hop online with their takes on what could have happened.</p><p>SANTA MONICA, CALIFORNIA - OCTOBER 22: Halle Bailey and DDG attend the 5th annual Wearable Art Gala honoring Angela Bassett and Mark Bradford at Barker Hangar on October 22, 2022 in Santa Monica, California.

They didn't let the world into too many of their intimate moments, but when they did, they boasted about one another. Back in November, the rapper visited The Breakfast Club and detailed why he was so taken with Bailey.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">“I’ve never been with nobody that’s like <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">really motivated me</a> like she do,” he said at the time. “I’m seeing different sh*t. I ain’t really been around this type of sh*t before. So, it’s like, she’s bringing me around sh*t that I ain’t really—you know what I’m saying?" DDG added, "I was my own person before her, but in a way, she put me on to different sh*t. That’s dope because I’m usually the one putting motherf*ckers on.”</p><span><h6 class=has-small-font-size>Read More: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Fans Think DDG & Halle Bailey Are Vacationing Together</a></h6></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Meanwhile, after unfollowing Bailey, DDG seemingly re-followed after going viral. People also believed he was insinuating that Halle cheated, which didn't bode over well. It was further noted that<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color"> DDG isn't private</a> regarding his love life, but for Halle, this is the first public relationship she's shared. The rapper earned himself backlash from Bailey's fans.
