It needed some warmth to pull the scheme together, so we added plum cushions on the dining chairs.’ The modern light fixture makes the space feel unpredictable and exciting.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QQzVvje3MY9N6UBUysaFcU-1920-80.jpg><h2 id=living-room-3>LIVING ROOM</h2><p>Has the living room is on the same level, I wanted the same to feel warm and cosy. ‘The addition of a waiting area created a perfect nook for two armchairs.’</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BqRfoeBrpXJsyXvibCRU5h-1920-80.jpg><h2 id=living-room-4>LIVING ROOM</h2><p>‘We originally propers the green floral you see on the pillows as the sofa fabric but the client was worries that her sons wouldn’t be so keen, so we introduced it in a smaller dose,’ says Heidi.</p><p>‘The lines of the furnishings feel both contemporary and classic, which the owner loved.
