Gone from the zombie drama based on <span data-scayt_word="Kirkman's" data-scaytid=5>Kirkman’s</span> comic series are series regular Austin Nichols’&nbsp;<a href=#>defiant Spencer</a>&nbsp;Monroe and recurring player Olivia (Ann Mahoney), the latter of whom oversaw the armory.</p><p>Spencer’s death largely mirrored the events of the comic, with <span data-scayt_word=Negan data-scaytid=6>Negan</span> slashing open his stomach after the former attempted to convince the bat-swinging villain that he would make a better leader than Rick (Andrew Lincoln).</p><p>Olivia, meanwhile, was shot in the face and made to pay for Rosita’s (Christian <span data-scayt_word=Serratos data-scaytid=9>Serratos</span>) shot at <span data-scayt_word=Negan data-scaytid=8>Negan</span> (and damage to his beloved bat, Lucille).</p><p>“I’m glad it wasn’t a walker in the woods; I’m glad it was <span data-scayt_word=Negan data-scaytid=11>Negan</span>. It was badass,” said Nichols of the way Spencer was killed off. He noted that for his two years on the series he hoped that Spencer would become a hero, but given the events of the comics, he wasn’t surprised to see the character be killed off.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p>Talking Dead also featured a special taped message from an emotional Mahoney, who said she knew Olivia’s run on The Walking Dead was up the minute <span data-scayt_word=showrunner data-scaytid=13>showrunner</span> Scott M. <span data-scayt_word=Gimple data-scaytid=14>Gimple</span> called her. “He said we never expected that people would like Olivia quite as much as the Olivia you created. He said it’s going to be quick and painless,” she recalled, calling Olivia the friend you instantly trust. “She takes care of people; she’s a nurturer. It’s a lovely going-away for a lovely person.”</p><p>As for Daryl killing off the Savior known as “Fat Joey,” <span data-scayt_word=Kirkman data-scaytid=15>Kirkman</span> noted it was an example of how much has changed for Norman <span data-scayt_word=Reedus data-scaytid=17>Reedus</span>‘ fan-favorite character.</p><p>“Daryl has been the peacemaker, telling Rick in past seasons, ‘We still need to bring people in and trust people,'” said&nbsp;<span data-scayt_word=Kirkman data-scaytid=18>Kirkman</span>. “And to see him snap shows how hard it has been for him at the Sanctuary and how much <span data-scayt_word=Negan data-scaytid=19>Negan</span> has gotten under his skin.”</p><p>“He’s ready to kick some ass; he’s in hate mode right now,” added&nbsp;<span data-scayt_word=Reedus data-scaytid=22>Reedus</span>. “It’s always been in the back of my mind — ‘I hope Maggie forgives me.’ I think he’s going through a whole bunch of stuff, but I do think he’s ready to kill someone.”</p><p>In terms of where the zombie drama goes when season seven returns Feb. 12, <span data-scayt_word=Reedus data-scaytid=24>Reedus</span> indicated that Daryl giving Rick his beloved gun back was a signal for him to fight back against <span data-scayt_word=Negan data-scaytid=25>Negan</span> and the Saviors. It was a similar message that <span data-scayt_word=Michonne data-scaytid=28>Michonne</span> had for Rick in the Alexandria jail cell that Morgan built last season.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p>“<span data-scayt_word=Michonne data-scaytid=29>Michonne</span> hasn’t gone through that journey that Rick has gone through. Seeing Abraham and Glenn die broke Rick down,” <span data-scayt_word=Kirkman data-scaytid=32>Kirkman</span> said. “But <span data-scayt_word=Michonne data-scaytid=30>Michonne</span> has always been in this mindset. That inspired him. <span data-scayt_word=Michonne data-scaytid=31>Michonne</span> is a stronger character than Rick Grimes. She handled this a lot better; she didn’t lose her nerve. Seeing that in her is what changed Rick’s mind.”</p><p>As for the mysterious figure seen stalking Father Gabriel as well as Rick and Aaron at the lake, <span data-scayt_word=Kirkman data-scaytid=37>Kirkman</span> remained mum. “It’s a big part of what we’re dealing with when we come back in the next half of season,” he said. “We’ll be revealing that soon.”</p><p>The first half of the season spent a lot of time building up communities including King Ezekiel’s Kingdom, establishing Maggie at the Hilltop, and setting up Carol on her own yet on the border of the Kingdom. Now that the group has been reunited in the finale, <span data-scayt_word=Kirkman data-scaytid=39>Kirkman</span> hinted that the second half would focus on business as usual.</p><p>“[It’s] Rick Grimes back to being Rick Grimes; Daryl Dixon back to being Daryl Dixon; the whole group back together ready to kick some ass.”</p><p>For more Walking Dead coverage, bookmark&nbsp;<a href=#>THR.com/<span data-scayt_word=WalkingDead data-scaytid=42>WalkingDead</span></a>.
