"I don't think we understood how serious that was," she said of her dad's first heart attack. "And then three years later he had another heart attack, and that one was fatal. It was so unexpected."</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><p id=eIEss9f1pLG data-wc=72>Savannah went on to detail her grief, which she said will last "until I leave this world". "I think it changes everything. I always think of it as on our calendars we have B.C. and A.D. There's a before and after. It's just this stark dividing line," she explained. "There's before my dad died and there's after, and it's profound. <strong>Grief is a lifelong process. I really believe that. There's acute grief</strong>."</p><p id=ecg2eAQGMNH data-wc=76>The 52-year-old went on to say: "There's different moments of grief, but I remember thinking even then when I was a late teenager, I always thought, I have a cup of grief now. It's like a cup of water and I'm going to spend the rest of my life emptying this cup. And sometimes it's coming out in buckets. And sometimes it's a little sprinkle and sometimes I can just hold it and nothing comes out.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/6496f776ceff-snapinstaapp412368642184054616740088933882030805955821309n1080.jpg><p id=ex_UtDnAGGP data-wc=38>"But every last drop of this cup will not be empty until I leave this world.
