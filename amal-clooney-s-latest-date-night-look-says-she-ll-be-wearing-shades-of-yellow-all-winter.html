Walking the black carpet arm in arm with George, Amal donned a vibrant lemon-colored Versace gown featuring a sweetheart neckline with spaghetti straps and a flowy A-line skirt that fell to the floor. A pair of metallic silver pointed-toe pumps, a coordinating sequined clutch, and massive diamond drop earrings rounded out her look.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Michael Buckner/Variety via Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When it came time for glam, her <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>hair and makeup artist, Dimitris Giannetos</a>, opted for a bronzed beat complete with a shimmery gold eye, feathered lashes, and a very glossy pout. Meanwhile, the "golden goddess" styled her long dark hair with tousled curls parted to the side, also perfected by Giannetos.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As for George, he sported a black suit with a navy blue button-down shirt underneath, which he paired with black boots and a silver timepiece.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At the premiere, George proved to be one proud husband, sharing with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Entertainment Tonight</a> that he's always "embarrassed" when Amal shows him her look for the evening.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"She cleans up," George said to ET.
