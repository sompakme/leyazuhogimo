"When he blew out his birthday candles, he FaceTimed his mom," a source told . "He was so sweet to all his guests." One person who apparently missed the bash was Nadine Leopold, the Victoria's Secret model who was supposedly dating the singer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/00b81c803c8d-rita-a.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=e4xLBnVBUK7X data-wc=10><strong>Harry Styles had four cakes to celebrate his big day</strong></p><p id=eoJfTDzwW3tK data-wc=112>He thanked his 23 million followers on Twitter for the birthday wishes, saying: "Thank you for all the lovely messages for my birthday. All the love. H." Fans also gave him a special present, raising money for one of his favourite charities in his honour.
