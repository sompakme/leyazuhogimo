"You know for my sister, this is her life long dream, so she didn't need any convincing," she told <strong style=background-color:initial;font-size:15px>HELLO!</strong> at the magazine's launch event in New York City on Thursday. "I'm a musician; I'm new at this. I'm not really a model, but it's a good thing to step out of your comfort zone. Me being an introvert, I don't do that often, so it was a surprisingly exhilarating and refreshing experience."</p><span><strong></strong></span> <strong></strong> <strong>Alexa admits it took a little convincing to go from musician to model for SI</strong> Photo: Rob Kim/FilmMagic<p id=epKyEL7bXN5S data-wc=92>The 31-year-old, who is also the daughter of <span><strong>Billy Joel</strong></span>, knew that the experience wasn't just about her, but celebrating women of all shapes and sizes. "I'm 5'3 and not often you get to see that in a magazine," she continued. "I think that what is so cool about Sports Illustrated is it's all different body shapes, all difference sizes. You have actresses, sports figures, musicians, so it's all about skin deep beauty sort of radiating to the outside, and that's what's so special. I had to be a part of it."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/152cb22f081e-body53-z.jpg> <strong>Alexa appeared in the 2017 SI Swimsuit Edition</strong> Photo: Emmanuelle Hauguel/Sports Illustrated<p id=e5edXGeqXT4W><a class=hm-link href=#>GALLERY: CELEBRITY MOTHER-DAUGHTER LOOK-A-LIKES</a></p><p id=ekIW7krVryB5 data-wc=94>Having Christie, 63, as a mom doesn't hurt, especially when she needs a slight boost of confidence. "She always reminds me about my posture," Alexa shared. "That's the big thing. Shoulders back and to smile. She's like 'smile, you look beautiful smiling,' that's her number one beauty tip." Alexa's proud mom, who appeared on three consecutive SI covers in 1979, 1980 and 1981, was all smiles as she talked about <a class=hm-link href=#>making her return to the magazine with her girls by her side</a> and witnessing a major moment for them. "You know it's really wonderful to see Sailor's dream coming true right before my eyes," she said.</p><strong>Christie shared that she was happy to see Alexa challenge herself</strong> Photo: Angela Weiss/AFP/Getty Images<p id=e5zhhxrcZiLk><a class=hm-link href=#>MORE: Christie's best beauty secrets</a></p><p id=e426B40FdDEY data-wc=108>"To be able to see that and be there is really special. And for Alexa it wasn't like her dream come true, it was a challenge for her and she accepted it and did it beautifully and I'm just so proud of her," the mom-of-three said. As for the one thing the supermodel mama told her daughters in order to keep them calm during the "colorful" shoot, "I just told them, you know it's not about what everybody else thinks. It's you feeling good about yourself," she explained. "Both of them knew that they had been eating right and exercising and this is their body, so rock it."</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
