Son of <a href=# rel>former legendary shot-blocker Manute Bol</a>, Bol Bol shares many similar traits with his father. With incredibly long limbs and a knack for timing his blocks, defensively Bol looks pretty much like a (slightly) smaller version of his father. He offers an interesting skill set that looks to be a great fit in perimeter centric schemes that currently dominate the NBA.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/urbanlinx.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/userfiles/60/04/000460_e4e38c6a9600169585e7a1c43779c4c8.jpg><p><h6>Mike Coppola/Getty Images</h6></p><p>And while Bol isn’t necessarily projected to be a lottery pick, he stole the show at the NBA Draft with his striking, black and white spiderweb suit. Bol clocked into the event rocking an insanely expensive suit, which&nbsp;he informed reporters, was designed and made by Atlanta rapper Young Thug. Thug is known for his love of all things luxe, designer and heavy on the wallet, so it's really no surprise that the custom suit his company designed for&nbsp;the ball player&nbsp;cashes&nbsp;in at a whopping six figures. The suit got quite a bit of air time, providing some pretty substantial marketing for Thug’s clothing line.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdiZ355hI9msKitnpx6tbTUoGSdnaOetK%2Bxw2aZqKRdl7ytv4ysn6ivXajBpq3LoqWgZZ6Xrm6w0ZqdrWWjqra1ec2erqw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nicola-marie-bloor-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html><span>←</span><span>Nicola Marie Bloor Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</span></a>
