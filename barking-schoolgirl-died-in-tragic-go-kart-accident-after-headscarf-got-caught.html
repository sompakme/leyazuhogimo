Ruwaida Adan, 15, was strangled by her hijab just minutes into a race with other teenagers attending a summer school organised through a local youth scheme. She was taken to hospital but died four days later in August 2021.</p><p>Ruwaida was visiting Capital Karts in Barking, East London, which has a policy that all loose clothing should be removed before getting into the cars, Walthamstow Coroner’s Court heard. During the inquest, Ruwaida’s family told jurors she had only recently started wearing a hijab but didn’t wear it all the time.</p><p><b>READ MORE: <a data-content-type=news data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>Man, 30s, dies after being hit by van in East London</a></b></p><p>Jurors heard Ruwaida should have been told to remove the headscarf and checks should have taken place at various stages during the induction to ensure this. But this did not happen and Ruwaida put on a balaclava and helmet over the top of her hijab. The end of the scarf was said to be hanging out of the helmet and suit.</p><p>Youth worker Zoe Cumberbatch, who was accompanying the teenagers, told jurors that staff at Capital Karts did not tell anyone taking part to remove loose clothing or tuck in their hair.</p><p>Ms Cumberbatch said track marshals did not tell her to tuck in her own hair, which she had styled in long braids, until she was getting into the cart at the start line. She became aware Ruwaida was in trouble after seeing another student bring their car to a stop and point at Ruwaida, who had also come to a stop. Jurors heard the cart was inspected after Ruwaida’s death and two parts designed to prevent loose items becoming entangled in the bottom of the cart were damaged.</p><p>Ruwaida, from Newham, died of a hypoxic brain injury and asphyxiation, the jury ruled. The jury concluded: “No safety check ensured that Ruwaida removed her headscarf before getting into her go car.</p><p>"No daily mechanics check was carried out on August 6, 2021. In Ruwaida’s cart the plastic drive belt guard to the rear axle was absent and the rear seat shield was damaged. Both should cover exposed moving parts. Ruwaida’s scarf became entangled in the moving parts resulting in her asphyxiation and her death on August 10, 2021.”</p><p>Assistant Coroner Leanne Woods has now issued a Prevention of Future Deaths report addressed to the managing director of Capital Karts raising a number of safety concerns.</p><p>The Barking branch of Capital Karts has now closed for unrelated reasons, the inquest heard, but the company still operates in <a data-content-type=section-topic data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=#>Canary Wharf</a>. The inquest heard Capital Karts has now changed its policy and requires a member of staff to witness a headscarf being removed at reception.</p><h5 class="publication-theme-icon publication-theme-border">Read More</h5><h5 class="hidden related-articles publication-theme-icon publication-font">Related Articles</h5><h5 class="publication-theme-icon publication-theme-border">Read More</h5><h5 class="hidden related-articles publication-theme-icon publication-font">Related Articles</h5><p>But the coroner said she is concerned about reliance on checks being carried out at reception and the lack of evidence about additional training and monitoring of track marshalls.</p><p>In the report, Ms Woods says: “I have a concern about the nature of Capital Karts' understanding of, and commitment to, addressing the concerns identified in the inquest about the adequacy of checks on clothing performed by marshalls.”</p><h3>'Her death has caused us all so much pain that we are all changed forever'</h3><p>After the inquest, Ruwaida’s family said in a statement: “Ruwaida was sweet and compassionate to everyone she met. She was so kind, thoughtful, caring, loving, strong and wise beyond her years. She was always speaking up for those who couldn’t speak up for themselves. She was always laughing and smiling – she had the most contagious laugh.</p><p>“Losing Ruwaida has been the hardest thing we have ever been through and losing her so unexpectedly makes it even worse.</p><p>"Not only has a big part of our family gone, but her death has caused us all so much pain that we are all changed forever. We miss Ruwaida every second of every day.”</p><p>The family’s lawyer Clare Campbell, from Leigh Day, said: “Ruwaida’s family are grateful to the coroner for investigating the circumstances around Ruwaida’s death and to the jury for their conclusion which found that no safety checks or mechanics checks were carried out on the day she died.</p><p>“They also welcome the coroner’s Prevention of Future Deaths report and hope that Capital Karting acts swiftly on the coroner’s concerns to ensure no other family has to go through the agony of losing their loved one.”</p><p>A spokesperson for Capital Karts said: "Everyone at Capital Karts was deeply shocked and saddened by the tragic death of Miss Adan, and our sympathies are with her family and friends.</p><p>"We cooperated fully with the authorities in their investigation and reviewed all of our safety procedures following the accident. We confirm that we will respond to the Coroner's request within the relevant time frame."</p><p><b id=docs-internal-guid-f91f783a-7fff-5e42-40a9-7073cc8c5b21><b><i>To get stories and breaking news from around London and the UK tailored to your preferences, sign up for one of our custom newsletters </i></b><a data-content-type=section data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=#><b><i><u>here.</u></i></b></a></b></p><p><b>READ NEXT:</b></p><h5 class="publication-theme-icon publication-theme-border">Read More</h5><h5 class="hidden related-articles publication-theme-icon publication-font">Related Articles</h5><h5 class="publication-theme-icon publication-theme-border">Read More</h5><h5 class="hidden related-articles publication-theme-icon publication-font">Related Articles</h5><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rsXLqKWdp55ju6bD0milnq%2BjZLKiv9Nmo6imlKS7brrEsKpon5mnuW59lGabop2UYrOzscCkZKCnXWeCdIKWcWtv</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./anderson-paak-net-worth-2024-updated-wealth-of-the-music-star.html><span>←</span><span>Anderson .Paak Net Worth 2024: Updated Wealth Of The Music Star</span></a>
