Still—allow me to convince you that you need to pick up an electric razor, too. And no, they’re not just meant to be used by men to shave their faces: electric razors can be used to get a closer shave than a traditional razor will, so they’re great to have on hand. But don’t just trust me—I spoke to <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.schweigerderm.com/providers/rachel-nazarian-m-d/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none><u>Dr. Rachel Nazarian</u></a>, a New York City-based dermatologist at the <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.schweigerderm.com/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Schweiger Dermatology Group</a>, and <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.linkedin.com/in/caitlin-orszulak-367b616/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Caitlin Orszulak</a>, Senior Scientist P&G Grooming—the company behind shaving brands like Gillette—about why electric razors are great tools to keep in your shaving arsenal, as well as how to use them and her favorite picks.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-overview><span>Overview</span></h2><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-why-to-use-an-electric-razor><span>Why to Use an Electric Razor</span></h2><p>Before you buy an electric razor and start using it for yourself, it’s important to know why and when you may want to use one over a traditional manual razor. Ultimately, it depends on the finished look you’re after and the type of electric razor that’s available to you. “Electric razors <strong>tend to pull hair up before cutting</strong>, making them a little bit more efficient than manual razors, and require fewer additional tools, such as <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/best-shaving-cream-for-women/><u>shaving cream</u></a>,” says Dr. Nazarian, noting that they might be better for those with sensitive skin because they “don’t have as close of a shave as a manual razor,” and that manual razors can cause irritation because the blade is in direct contact with the skin.</p><p>Think of it this way: If you’re trimming or shaving an area on your body (Think: <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/how-to-shave-your-bikini-line/><u>shaving your bikini line</u></a> with a dedicated <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/g36079721/best-bikini-trimmers/>bikini line trimmer</a> or your underarm area if you don’t normally shave there), an electric razor is your best bet. However, if you’re maintaining a close, smooth <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/a32731980/how-to-shave-your-legs/><u>shave on your legs</u></a>, for example, a traditional razor may work better for you.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-where-to-use-an-electric-razor><span>Where to Use an Electric Razor</span></h2><p>“For women, using an electric razor on the pubic area tends to be a popular choice due to the hair in that region being thicker than other places,” says Orszulak. This is because the hair in your pubic area tends to be thicker, coarser, and follow a different curl pattern or texture compared to other hair on your body. Electric razors can reduce the <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/a22999432/how-to-get-rid-of-ingrown-hair/>risk of ingrown hairs</a> in that area because the hair isn’t cut as close to the skin.&nbsp;</p><p>“An electric razor also can be easier to control the amount of hair you want to remove, which can differ from person to person—some may opt to only trim around the “bikini line” and keep hair everywhere else, in which case an electric razor is a great choice for,” she continues.&nbsp;</p><p>Electric razors also are a great option for women who do choose to shave their face and who may not be as comfortable using a traditional razor blade on delicate skin there. “An electric razor is a great solve here [on the face], as it can feel less invasive due to it not having an exposed sharp edge,” says Orszulak, who specifically recommends the Gillette Venus for Facial Hair & Skin Mini Hair Remover for the area thanks to its rotary blade design that leaves your skin feeling smooth and irritation-free," she says.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-when-to-use-an-electric-razor><span>When to Use an Electric Razor</span></h2><p>Dr. Nazarian says that electric razors "can be used on either dry or wet skin, allowing for more flexibility in your routine," she says. However, it's important to note that you'll get a closer shave with manual razors—Dr. Nazarian says that this is because they "have more surface tension as they glide across the skin," while electric razors don't cause the same surface tension. If you’re planning on using an electric razor in the shower, make sure that you buy one that is waterproof.&nbsp;</p><p>Keep scrolling to shop for the best electric razors for women.

It's been 6 months. Still loving it. I wanted a more environmentally friendly option than razors for shaving. This shaver charges quick, shaves close and cleans easy. It can be a bit slippery if you use it in the shower but otherwise a wonderful thing to have in your beauty arsenal. It does take some getting used to on how to hold it appropriately for shaving different areas, and I have nicked myself once or twice but that just proves it's sharp. The light on it is crucial for me to get a close shave. Will say if you're looking for a totally silky smooth shave you may want to follow up with a razor. I would say this gives a 1 day old shave but that's preferred for me to avoid sensitive skin flare up. Overall very impressed and at the price point, would absolutely invest in a backup one.”&nbsp;</p><a href=# data-model-name="Panasonic Close Curves Electric Razor for Women" data-url=https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Electric-Cordless-3-Blade-Operation/dp/B09DLCMLRL referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=141596&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2FPanasonic-Electric-Cordless-3-Blade-Operation%2Fdp%2FB09DLCMLRL%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dhawk-custom-tracking-20" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name="Amazon US" data-merchant-id=1471 data-merchant-url=amazon.com data-merchant-network=Amazon readability=1><p class=vanilla-image-block data-bordeaux-image-check><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aMoHsdM3nW4bHW4wwzyCLG-1920-80.jpg><span class="featured__label horizontal__label">Best Electric Razor for a Close Shave</span></p></a><p>Panasonic Close Curves Electric Razor for Women</p><p>This tool uses three floating blades for a super close, painless shave every time you use it.

I hate shaving my legs, takes so long and kills my back. This makes it a lot easier to get a nice, easy shave. The adjustable blades make it easy to chip away at the thicker-haired areas and the normal setting is great for the legs. Waterproof is really nice, very easy to clean too which is nice in comparison to other trimmers I've used. It obviously doesn't give a completely smooth shave, you'll still need to use a razor if you want those shiny, smooth legs, but this is great if you just want to LOOK like you have shaved legs, also makes using a razor a lot easier. My only real complaint is that it's quite loud, but it's not a big deal at all.

For electric razors specifically, that means that you can pick from one of three common types: rotary, foil, and single-blade razors. Ahead, Orszulak quickly breaks down exactly what each style is and how they work.</p><ul><li><strong>Rotary: “</strong>This will have blades that spin in a circular direction,” She says. “There are usually multiple rotating blades, which are covered by a circular foil, on a single head; these may be able to follow contours of the face more easily vs. a foil shaver.”&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Foil: </strong>“The cutting blades are covered with thin sheets of metal foil, essentially acting like a cage over the sharp blades,” Orszulak tells me about this kind of razor. &nbsp;“The “cage”—foil—protects the skin from coming into direct contact with the sharp blades. As the shaver moves over the skin, the foil can lift hairs and direct them to the blades.”&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Single-Blade: </strong>Single-blade trimmers “will have a guard that remains stationary, contacting skin while a cutting blade oscillates left and right above it, cutting the hairs being fed into the blades,” says Orszulak&nbsp;</li></ul><h3 class=article-body__section id=section-meet-the-expert><span>Meet The Expert</span></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YiBExWTN8joNTGBB7Q4i4g-1920-80.png><span class=person__name>Rachel Nazarian, M.D., F.A.A.D.</span><a class=button-social href=# aria-label=INSTAGRAM><span class=button-social__icon></span></a><a class=button-social href=# aria-label=WEBSITE><span class="button-social__icon button-social__icon-website"></span></a>Dermatologist at the Schweiger Dermatology Group<p><a href=#>Dr. Rachel Nazarian</a> joins Schweiger Dermatology after years of practicing various aspects of dermatology, including cosmetic treatments, skin cancer, general dermatology and dermatologic surgery.Dr. Nazarian has written many published articles in medical journals as well as widely respected dermatology textbooks, such as Treatment of Skin Disease.
