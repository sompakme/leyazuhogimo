The rapper isolated himself in Utah where he locked in projects like <a href=# rel>The Last Slimeto</a> and I Rest My Case.</p><p>YB made the most of his time but it appears that a judge decided to loosen up some conditions. Per All Hip Hop, Judge Shelly Dick removed two conditions from his restrictive release. One, in particular, allows YB to invite more than three guests into his home at a time. “No more than three persons may visit Gaulden at his home at any time. (19) No visitors are allowed at the Defendant’s home before 7 a.m. or after 9 p.m. ‘Home’ is defined as the Defendant’s residence and all property and appurtenances of the residence. It is so ordered. Signed in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, this 15th day of March 2023,” the ruling reads.</p><span><h2 id=h-nba-youngboy-s-house-arrest-conditions>NBA Youngboy’s House Arrest Conditions</h2></span><p>HOLLYWOOD, CALIFORNIA - JANUARY 16: Judge Greg Mathis and NBA Youngboy arrive at The Benjamin Crump Awards at The Venue of Hollywood on January 16, 2020 in Hollywood, California. (Photo by Maury Phillips/Getty Images)</p><p>NBA Youngboy’s remained on house arrest since late 2021. In October of that year, the rapper put up $1.5M bail. The judge ordered him to live on house arrest. The conditions didn’t allow more than three visitors at a time outside of his wife, business manager, and producer, who also resided in the same home. However, his latest attempt proved fruitful since he attempted to get off <a href=# rel>house arrest</a> in July, though the judge denied the bid.</p><p>While YB could’ve lived anywhere, he opted for a quieter environment in Utah, which has been his creative haven. Though isolated, he honed into his craft, maintaining a sense of peace, despite the chaos that surrounds him in the music industry. It was during this time that he also secured a deal with Motown Records, ending his tenure with Atlantic, who he’s been signed to since late 2017. Hopefully, he’ll be a free man soon and we’ll get to see the rapper hit the road once his legal issues are resolved.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">[Via]</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdmaYR4hZFmpZuZXa68trrGm6ayq12dvLa%2FxGaYq6qVqMFur86nm6KsmaS7tHnMqJuinpmasW7AzmaYpaSfrHq3tdKiq6iqo2K%2FprzOq6s%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./legendary-screen-star-rod-steiger-dies-aged-77.html><span>←</span><span>LEGENDARY SCREEN STAR ROD STEIGER DIES AGED 77</span></a>
