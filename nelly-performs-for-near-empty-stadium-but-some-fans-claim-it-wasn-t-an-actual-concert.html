While a lot of folks are running with the narrative that <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Ashanti</a>'s <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">boo</a> just failed to sell barely any tickets to his show, some folks in the comments of the post below pointed out that this might be a soundcheck. "I hate when people try to embarrass people. That clearly looks like a sound check to me," one fan wrote, whereas The Game, of all people, had another way of looking at this.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Nothing to see here," the rapper wrote in the comments section of the IG post below. "He got paid probably 60-100K to perform even if it was only one person there. Sometimes promoters drop the ball on promoting shows so it’s not on bruh. Enjoy ya Sunday." Whether or not you think this is an actual performance or a prelude to it, folks are certainly far too quick to criticize celebrities when they don't meet the grand standards that they, and fans, set for themselves. Either that or they have fun with pregnancy rumors, and Nelly is <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">no stranger to either</a>.</p><span></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Furthermore, we wonder if this would've been a big issue back in the St. Louis MC's heyday, a hip-hop era which he believes was the hardest to come up in. "<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Country Grammar was 5 million</a> and I didn’t even get nominated as a Best New Artist because my album came out in 2000," Nelly told The Shop. "So I wasn’t even on the ballot in 2001. The great, talented, well-deserving <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Alicia Keys</a> won, and she should’ve won in 2001.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"You gotta understand, my era of music was <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">the toughest era in hip-hop ever!</a>" he continued. "When I put out songs, I had to go against <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>DMX</a>, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Jay-Z</a>, Eminem, Lil Wayne, 50 Cent, and Ludacris. All of us are fighting for one spot. So from '99 to 2008, 2010, it was the hardest era ever."
