On August 24, Stracke made her relationship with television producer Sanjit Das <a href=#>Instagram</a> official. She captioned a selfie with her beau, "Good things do come out of #rhobh."</p><p dir=ltr>Viewers have already been introduced to Das on "The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills." Stracke met him on Bumble, per <a href=#>The U.S. Sun</a>, and she revealed that they bonded over their appreciation for college football while getting to know one another over drinks. Das got to hear exactly what Stracke thought of him when they were having a&nbsp;FaceTime conversation and her castmates snatched her phone. "Excuse me, I actually like him!" she blurted out, not realizing that Das could hear her. Their future together didn't look hopeful when Sutton mentioned the possibility of meeting up for a third time and Das didn't respond, but it looks like he was interested after all.</p><p dir=ltr>According to <a href=#>J-Archive</a>, Das competed on "Jeopardy!" in 2001. While the Virginia native didn't win, he did go home with a Princess Caribbean cruise. Das once worked as the head of ABC's digital team and is currently employed by Moloko Entertainment, according to <a href=#>his website</a>. His bio reads, "As a multiple Emmy-winning executive, I've had the good fortune of working with some of the best storytellers in the world on high-profile television and sports properties." Sounds like a catch!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcnBhaoF6e9Ghppugo2LAtsDTqKVmq6SnrqS3xGahrqukYsGwu8pmmGaamZx6s7HLmquip56otaq8jKyrnqhdrLa1tIyhnKtlnprEbrnAp2Y%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./max-holloway-revisits-the-time-he-got-called-a-tony-ferguson-lookalike-by-a-fan-who-didn-t-recognize.html><span>←</span><span>Max Holloway revisits the time he got called a Tony Ferguson lookalike by a fan who didn't recognize</span></a>
