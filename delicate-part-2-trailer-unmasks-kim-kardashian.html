The 12th season in FX’s hit horror anthology from Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk was split into two parts, an effect of the 2023 dual Hollywood strikes. The first five episodes of AHS: Delicate concluded in October 2023, and now the final four episodes will kick off weekly beginning April 3. And the trailer (below) for the back-half of the season shows that viewers will finally get some answers around the mysteries swirling over the starring trio played by Emma Roberts, Kim Kardashian and Cara Delevingne."><meta name=author content="Jenniffer Sheldon"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

In the new footage, Anna tells her best friend and publicist Siobhan Corbyn, played by Kim Kardashian, that she would give up “anything” for fame. Their tumultuous relationship continues, as they are seen kissing one moment, and then Siobhan slapping Anna in the face in another.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The trailer ends with enough body horror, blood and AHS imagery that a franchise viewer could come to expect in a first look’s crescendo, until finally unmasking Kardashian’s character as the villain viewers may have suspected, even if her “best friend” remained in the dark.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">This season’s psychological horror story was, for the first time, based on a novel: Danielle Valentine’s&nbsp;Delicate Condition and written by one writer, showrunner Halley Feiffer. The novel centered around an expecting actress (Roberts) who becomes convinced that a sinister figure is going to great lengths to make sure her pregnancy never happens. A cover blurb on the novel<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>&nbsp;described the story&nbsp;</a>as “the feminist update to&nbsp;Rosemary’s Baby&nbsp;we all needed.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Karadshian and Delevigne were both newcomers to&nbsp;AHS, while Roberts (who has starred on previous cycles&nbsp;Coven,&nbsp;Freak Show,&nbsp;Cult,&nbsp;Apocalypse&nbsp;and&nbsp;1984) made her return after a four-year hiatus. Michaela Jaé Rodriguez (Pose), Matt Czuchry, Annabelle Dexter-Jones, Maaz Ali and Juliana Canfield round out the main cast.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">AHS: Delicate releases its final four episodes weekly on Wednesdays at 10pm ET/PT on FX,&nbsp;streaming the next day on Hulu.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue9OvZq2uXaOyuL%2BOmqSeqpmYrq95x6ipq6eiYsC1u9GyZJ2dnJ6wosDEZqeaqqRif27A0ZqgpZ2iYriquYykmKuckai1qq3NZmhra2VtgneElG5m</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./alexis-vogel-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html><span>←</span><span>Alexis Vogel Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</span></a>
