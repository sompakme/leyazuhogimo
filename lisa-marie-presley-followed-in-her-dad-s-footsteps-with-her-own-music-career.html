But instead, she first focused on her raising a family before realizing that she wanted to carve her own path in music. "My main focus was I'm gonna try to break through this regardless and try to get my own fans and hopefully allow my music to affect others like it's done for me in my life," she told <a href=#>Goldmine</a>. The singer went on to release three albums in her later years: "To Whom It May Concern," in 2003,&nbsp;"Now What" in 2005, and "Storm & Grace" in 2012 (per <a href=#>AllMusic</a>).&nbsp;</p><p>In her journey to making a name for herself, Presley was adamant about deviating from her father's legacy. Sure, she had his name, but she never wanted to be defined by it. "It [her famous lineage] is not something I want to fight because I'm not proud of it. I want to fight it to prove I'm completely different than him," she explained to <a href=#>The Baltimore Sun</a> in 2012. She later learned that it was harder than she thought it would be, given the weight attached to the name.&nbsp;People couldn't help but make comparisons. "I'm not him, I could never be like him, ever, and I don't want to try. I just want to be a singer-songwriter," Presley shared at the time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamlmbYZxf46loKyZXaKus7XEZqernaOhsrp5xaijpaenmrFutc1mn56qXZmupb%2BMn6aorKOpsrG%2FjLCgraBdnbKzec6wpWalpai2pHnCmqmenaJk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lil-poppa-reflects-on-industry-hardships-growing-up-in-jacksonville-more-in-on-the-come-up.html><span>←</span><span>Lil Poppa Reflects On Industry Hardships, Growing Up In Jacksonville &amp;amp; More In &amp;quot;On The Come Up&amp;quot;</span></a>
