In the first film, we only saw an origin story of the classic villain, so his second outing is the logical time to unleash his full potential as Aquaman’s arch-nemesis with more than 50 years' worth of comics history to look to for inspiration.</p><p>"I can tell you that [James Wan's] concepts for Aquaman 2 are pushing it even further,” teased Wilson.</p><p>"Of course, I want to know everything, but I also have a great respect for him and the process to know that I’m OK staying out of it until it’s late in the game. Sometimes, there’s so much information that I don’t ask because I don’t want to know, and I don’t want him to go, 'I can’t tell you that yet.'</p><p>"I have a few ideas of where Orm fits in, but I’m not gonna talk about them."</p><p>In August 2020, James Wan claimed that we could see rather a different film to the original Aquaman in terms of its tone.</p><p>Speaking at a DC Fan Dome virtual panel, the director said, “I think the second one is a little bit more serious, a little bit more relevant in the world we are living in today. I think that’s where it wants to go."</p><p>Warner Bros' official Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom synopsis reads: “When an ancient power is unleashed, Aquaman must forge an uneasy alliance with an unlikely ally to protect Atlantis, and the world, from irreversible devastation.”</p><p><h6 class="mb-xs text-left heading-6">More like this</h6></p><h2 id=what-happened-in-aquaman-6834ce41><strong>What happened in Aquaman?</strong></h2><p>Set some time after 2017’s Justice League, Aquaman saw Arthur attempt to claim his destiny as the King of Atlantis from his brother-turned-foe Orm.</p><p>Hell-bent on igniting a war between those above and below sea level, Orm enlisted the help of Black Manta to seal his place above the other underwater kings as the Ocean Master. The only hope being, if Arthur, always reluctant to recognise his responsibility, usurp his half-brother as the rightful King. Doing this meant acquiring the lost Trident of Atlan, an ancient relic that can only be wielded by the true king of the sea. With it, Arthur was able to rally the support of all forces threatening the overworld and turn them against Orm.</p><p>However, in a post-credits scene a recovering Black Manta swore his revenge, so we doubt this is the last we've heard of that storyline.</p><h2 id=when-will-a-trailer-be-released-0fbd4e4d><strong>When will a trailer be released?</strong></h2><p>The first trailer was shown during an exclusive presentation to CinemaCon 2023 audience members in April, so it hopefully shouldn't be too long before the wider world gets to see it.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel=noopener>Deadline</a>, the trailer features Jason Momoa‘s Aquaman, who now has a child, Dr Stephen Shin (Randall Park) on an arctic expedition, and the Black Trident, a weapon that Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) vows to use to “destroy Aquaman and everything he holds dear".</p><p>Amber Heard's character Mera also appears in the footage according to reports and, according to Deadline, has a cameo in a battle scene in the movie.</p><p><strong>Aquaman 2 is set to hit cinemas on 17th March 2023 - find out what else to watch with our <a href=#>TV Guide</a>.</strong></p><p>Advertisement</p><p><strong>Try Radio Times magazine today and get 12 issues for only £1 with delivery to your home – </strong><a href=#><strong>subscribe now</strong></a><strong>.
