They have their own loft because they're more important than most people," Troy said.</p><p>The loft has a string of fairy lights, a large dog bed with toys, and even a salt-rock lamp.</p><p>The only item up there for the couple is their safe to keep valuables secure.</p><p>An aerial view from the loft shows the living area with a large two-person sofa and a wall-mounted television.</p><p>Under the loft, there is the kitchen and the bathroom with a toilet, storage space, and a shower.</p><p>A captain's door separates the living area from the bathroom for privacy.</p><p>The bathroom then leads out across the deck to the bedroom.</p><p>Both sheds are insulated so "it stays super cool in the summer and super warm in the winter," Troy said.</p><p>The room has a double bed, storage space, a charging station, and a television.</p><p>Viewers fell in love with the <a href=#>tiny home,</a> with one person commenting: "I want one of these!!"</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Another added: "This is freaking awesome, I can't wait till my kids grow up this is my plan!
