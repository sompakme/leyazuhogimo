Every time, I convinced myself that he couldn't possibly mess up a simple one inch trim, and every time, I ended up looking like Spock.</p><p>I tell you this sad cautionary tale because <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/miley-cyrus/>Miley Cyrus</a> is significantly more blessed than I in the "parents who can cut hair department" (you're my hero, Dad, but your talents lie elsewhere). On her Instagram story, she debuted a short, spiky "pixie mullet"—the work of none other than her mom, one Tish Cyrus. Miley also shared some solid mullet inspiration, posting photos of Blondie's Debbie Harry and The Runaways' Cherie Currie.</p><p>Celebrity hair stylist Sally Hershberger—the architect of Miley's original, longer mullet—also posted a photo of the new cut, explaining that she guided Tish's every snip over FaceTime. Speaking to&nbsp;People, Hershberger&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://people.com/style/miley-cyrus-mom-tish-cut-her-hair-pixie-mullet-sally-hershberger-exclusive/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>revealed</a>&nbsp;that Tish's finished handiwork didn't quite line up with Miley's original vision: "Miley sent me over a picture for inspiration, but this pixie mullet is completely different than the original inspiration photo," she said.</p><p>Still, Miley was evidently satisfied with her final look. "Miley loved the final look as much as I did! It’s so cool and daring to mesh together two styles into one that really expresses her own sense of style," Hershberger said. "She’s such a great client to work with since she’s so open to trying new looks. We were both really happy with how the haircut turned out and I’m sure her mom will keep tweaking it a bit."</p><p>For more stories like this, including celebrity news, beauty and fashion advice, savvy political commentary, and fascinating features, sign up for the&nbsp;Marie Claire&nbsp;newsletter.<br></p><p><a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url="https://preferences.hearstmags.com/brands/MAR/subscribe.aspx?authId=F0CC0C27-80DA-4734-ABDF-E4115B84A56B&maj=WNL&min=ARTICLES" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none><strong>subscribe here</strong></a></p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.
