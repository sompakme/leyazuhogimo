She was allergic to it so she sniffled and sneezed the entire time," he explained of their meeting in 2006. She was 30 at the time and he was 28.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"And when I get nervous, you might have noticed I talk a lot," Jackson went on. "So I just chewed her ear off for an hour and a half … It was amazing. I'm surprised she ever called back."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Well, it sounds like she nearly didn't.</p><p><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Kruger told Conan host Conan O'Brien</a> that she wasn't even aware that she and Jackson were going on a date on that fateful evening in 2006, as his invitation had been unclear.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Joe Schildhorn/Patrick McMullan via Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"He thinks he asked me out on a date, which is not true, because I did not agree to that. I agreed to have drinks with him," she said. "I actually had plans with someone else for dinner, so I know I didn't say yes to dinner. We were sitting at the bar, and it's nine o'clock, and I'm ready to leave. And he was like, 'Let's go, we have dinner reservations.' And I felt really bad because he looked very eager and he put on a clean shirt. And so I was like, 'OK, fine. Let's go.'"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Kruger thought her allergies might cut the date short, but alas …</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I thought he might say, 'Let's call it a day. I'll bring you home,'" she remembered. "And of course not. He talked about himself for an hour and a half. Nonstop."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Oh and it gets worse.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"He took me back to my hotel in his car, which was a piece of shit," she went on. "Excuse me, but it was. The door was eaten by his dog, it smelled so bad. If you know Josh, you know he was not the tidiest of guys, so trust me, it was not cute."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Stephane Cardinale/Corbis via Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And, after all that, he still went in for a kiss. "I swear to God, at the end, I was like 'Should I slap him?'" Kruger admitted.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Jackson's post-date save, however, was impeccable. The next day he sent her flowers … with a box of Kleenex.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">By the end of 2006, the ambiguity was gone and Jackson and Kruger were establishing themselves as a red carpet mainstay.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Within a couple of years, the couple's unique attitude toward marriage became the media's focus. Kruger, who'd previously been married to director Guillaume Canet, explained (repeatedly) that she and Jackson didn't equate marriage with commitment. "No paper you have signed will keep you around," she told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Allure</a> in 2010.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Two years later, Jackson told Us Weekly, "Marriage is important for the people it's important for, but neither one of us is particularly religious, so I don't think there's any particular push." But, like any good media-trained person in the public eye, he kept the door open, adding, "But never say never! I don't know."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-we-loved-them></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why We Loved Them</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Given Kruger's background as a model and her omnipresence at fashion week, it was only natural that Jackson up his style game.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"When you are in a relationship, you want the other person to appreciate the things you like," Kruger told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Glamour</a> of Jackson's sartorial transformation. "It sounds superficial, but it's nice."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And, naturally, that comes with sacrifice.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Jeffrey Ufberg/WireImage</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I used to have a collection of Adidas sneakers, but one day all the obnoxiously colored ones disappeared," Jackson told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Glamour</a> in a separate interview. "[Diane] still claims I must have lost them 'somewhere.'"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2015, Jackson praised Kruger for her confidence and how she channels that into her style, telling <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The Hollywood Reporter</a>, "One of the most attractive things to me about Diane is how confident she is in herself as a woman and in her beauty, and how much self-respect she has and the way that manifests itself in the way she dresses." Joshua!</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_53-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He acknowledged that he'd learned a thing or two from her through the years, too. "I certainly pay more attention to how I dress now than I did a decade ago before we started dating," he said.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_55-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>CHANCE YEH/Patrick McMullan via Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_58-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Jackson also proved that he could be of assistance in a fashion emergency when Kruger attended what is arguably the world's most red carpet-driven film festival: Cannes. For closing night in 2012, the Inglourious Basterds star opted for a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>glamorous Dior gown</a> complete with a massive hoop skirt that took her an hour to put on and threatened to never come off.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_60-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Once I finished dinner, I had to go to the bathroom, and it became so tight that I couldn't breathe anymore," Kruger told People. "Josh had to come with me to the lady's room and cut me out of it," she went on. "He literally had to help me remove the dress to help me go to the bathroom. It was crazy!"</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_62-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Frazer Harrison/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_63-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"That's real love, isn't it," she told the publication, "to have someone like him help me in the weirdest situations. He's great and he's like my hero."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-when-they-peaked></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_67-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>When They Peaked</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_68-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Jackson and Kruger's relationship was (by all public accounts) a retelling of the movie Four Christmases: a modern couple who prioritizes international travel over marriage finds themselves ensnared in ~quirky~ familial ~hijinks~.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_70-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Such was the case when Kruger introduced Jackson to her German mother.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_72-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Kruger, who said she'd only bring men to meet her mother if the relationship was "somewhat serious,"<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1> explained to Jimmy Kimmel</a> that it's a German tradition to have coffee and cake when you return home. When Jackson visited, Kruger stressed the importance of this ritual.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_76-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I said, 'You have to have cake. You have to have coffee. Even if you don't like it.' He has a nut allergy. It had almonds in it. I was like, 'You're eating it. You're definitely doing it.' And so he did."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_78-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Um, what is up with this couple's casual disregard for the danger of allergic reactions?</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_80-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images for Veuve Clicquot</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_81-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Anyway, things were going well and ostensibly no EpiPens had been deployed, when Kruger's mother brought over a folder filled with clippings of Jackson — like, 5th grade collage-crafting style.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_83-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Included in this dossier was Jackson's 2002 mugshot that the actor earned after "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>drunkenly assaulting a security guard</a>" at a hockey game in Raleigh, N.C.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_85-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Kruger was not amused by her mother's stunt.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_87-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"She thought it would be cute to go, 'So I see you've been arrested in 1997 at the hockey game.' And says, 'Whose fault was it?'" Diane added. "We were there for three days, we did not speak for two. It was not good."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_89-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Mortifying as that sounds, you've got to admit that's some grade-A rom-com material …</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-breakup></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_91-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Breakup</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_92-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In July 2016, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>People</a> reported that Jackson and Kruger had split after 10 years together, with little detail given other than that they "remain friends."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_94-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And if this <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>airport embrace</a> is to be taken into account, it seems they did.

"You don't break up overnight after ten years," she added.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_100-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Mary Rozzi/ Getty Images for amFar</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_101-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It wasn't like an urgent, 'Oh my god, I can't sleep at night' thing," she said of the process.
