If you ever find yourself in a romantic relationship with Marvel Comics and it tells you that it’s pregnant with your baby, you can be damned sure it’s just a trick to throw you off of the truth, which is that it’s actually a comic company disguised as a woman.

The river of misinformation usually revolves around the amount of villains a movie has, but this instance involves Marvel mastermind Stan Lee’s cameos in the comic giant’s films over the years. Lee had previously said that he definitely <a href=#>wouldn’t appear</a> in James Gunn’s <a href=#><i>Guardians of the Galaxy</i></a>, but now the 91-year-old cat has been let out of the bag and Lee has confirmed he’ll be keeping the streak alive after all.<span id=more-93360></span></p><p>As part of a Q&A on Sunday at Chicago’s c2e2 expo, Lee took a fan’s question as to whether he’d show up in <a href=#><i>Guardians of the Galaxy</i></a> or not. And in the very rare instance of a comic-con question getting the opposite of the expected answer, Lee said he is indeed a small part of the cast. Marvel is keeping the details on a tight leash, but Lee was able to offer up a few intriguing words.</p><p>“I can’t tell you what it is,” <a href=#>Lee said</a>, “but I can tell you I do not understand what it was or why I did it. It has me with a girl — a very pretty girl — that’s all I can tell you.”</p><p>There are a few ways to take these words. The first involves taking them completely at face value and assuming Stan Lee has gone completely senile and just shows up where people point the hardest. The second is thinking he’s slyly describing the bit part itself, and he maybe plays a completely senile old man (there’s a theme here) who has a hot nurse taking care of him. Of course, he could just be trying to make a joke of what he said back in January when he first denied his involvement with the comedic sci-fi adventure.</p><p>“That’s the one group I didn’t create,” he told Dweebcast at the time. “I didn’t write <i>Guardians of the Galaxy</i>. I’m not even sure who they all are. I can’t wait to see the movie.” I kind of like to think that Stan Lee’s side of any dialogue involves a previously rendered conversation in his mind that comes out in edited, slightly out of context bursts.</p><p>Wouldn’t it be fantastic if Lee’s cameo coincided with <a href=#>Nathan Fillion’s probably non-existent cameo</a>? You can’t take the sky from Star Lord (Chris Pratt), Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Drax the Destroyer (Dave Bautista), Groot (Vin Diesel), or Rocket Raccoon (Bradley Cooper). But some will try. (I firmly apologize for ruining two different brands of science fiction just then.)</p><p>Care to see all but the most recent of Lee’s appearances in past Marvel films? Check out the video below and listen to Groot say “I am Groot,” when <i>Guardians of the Galaxy</i> rockets into theaters on August 1.</p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2irk56zqnvSrZinZZyasm6z1JqpnaGRo8Bus8ClmLGxXZiurrHOZqOyoZ6cerOt0pyYpWaYqbqt</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./shai-x-messi-sga-drops-greatest-instagram-caption-ever-after-buzzer-beater.html><span>←</span><span>Shai x Messi: SGA drops greatest Instagram caption ever after buzzer-beater</span></a>
