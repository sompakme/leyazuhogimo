The new retailer will be priced slightly higher than H&M, similarly to the & Other Stories and COS brands (for example, men's shirts will start at around $42 and go upward to $120). Along with fashion, the stores will also include a Nordic cafe where you can shop healthy food or eat in (so basically a more Instagram-able version of Whole Foods).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"We really believe it's relevant to a modern customer to bring different brands together—under one roof, under one channel—and to make that choice for them and also make it more convenient," Ulrika Bernhardtz, Arket's creative director, told BoF.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But Arket isn't rolling out in the U.S. quite yet. The new brand will open its first store on London's Regent Street this summer followed by additional stores in Brussels, Copenhagen and Munich. So looks like you'll just have to book a Euro-trip to shop the new store in the meantime.</p><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/765453da-3fc9-4650-8bff-01664371711e_1704808979.png alt="Headshot of Lauren Alexis Fisher" title="Headshot of Lauren Alexis Fisher" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Lauren Alexis Fisher is the Senior Editor at Cosmopolitan, overseeing digital content across fashion, lifestyle, beauty, sex, and culture.
