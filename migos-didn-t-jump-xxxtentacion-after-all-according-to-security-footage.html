In fact, the two men who tried to jump the Florida native, while sporting some dreads and supposedly some "Migo Gang" pendants, reportedly have no affiliation with the hip-hop group whatsoever. The young emcee blasted all three Migos members on social media over the course of the last 48 hours, even taking the time to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">let Cardi B know</a> that he had no beef with her, only Offset.</p><p>However, now that there is tangible proof that the men who jumped him weren't who he thought they were, XXXTentacion was quick to offer up an apology to Takeoff on Instagram, saying: ''From the Bottom of my heart I apologize to you, you only caught in the cross fire of your blood line, blessings." There's no word yet if he's reached out to the other Migos.</p><p>The rap trio also made headlines for a totally different reason yesterday (November 14th), when it was announced they were being included on&nbsp;Forbes' "30 Under 30" list. They joined the likes of <a href=# class=text-word rel>Cardi B</a>, <a href=# class=text-word rel>Young Thug</a> and <a href=# class=text-word rel>SZA</a> as members of the hip-hop and R&B community who had very strong years in the music business. Only time will tell if Migos stick together or if each respective member decides to go their own way and pursue some solo work, but it's clear that, at least this year, they've been a force to be reckoned with.</p><p><br><h2>Migos</h2></p><p>Migos Didn't Jump XXXTentacion After All, According To Security Footage</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdobYJ5goymoKCno2KxqrDNrWSjrZ2lernE162cp6yRmLawuoyana2domKurbiMmpqcp6KZtq%2BzjK2mZquVmMKztdOyZJ%2Bnn6muqLGMp5ywqw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./michael-b-jordan-biography-movies-net-worth-wife-age-children-tv-shows-father-basketball-g.html><span>←</span><span>Michael B.
