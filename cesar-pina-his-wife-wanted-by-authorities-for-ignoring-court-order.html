Moreover, for those unaware, he filed for bankruptcy following a long series of Ponzi scheme allegations against him accusing him of fraud. In fact, Pina's former business partner DJ Envy also experienced some blowback as a result, although he's since <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">exited the case as a perpetrator</a>. As for this current development, New Jersey Judge Rosemary Gambardella ordered U.S. Marshals to arrest Cesar and his wife Jennifer Iturralde Pina on Tuesday (February 20), according to court documents reportedly obtained by AllHipHop.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Specifically, the judge brought up the couple's contempt over a December 2023 court order as the reasoning behind this arrest. Apparently, Cesar Pina and his wife ignored orders to provide documentation for <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">their bankruptcy case</a> despite "good and sufficient notice." DJ Envy seemingly complied with his subpoena around the same time as this ignored court order. Nevertheless, according to Judge Gambardella's orders, U.S. Marshals will arrest the two on or after Friday (February 23). Not only that, but the judge also called for officials to "use reasonable force to execute this order" to bring them to Newark, and to "arrest any person who impedes its execution."</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-cesar-pina-in-october-2022>Cesar Pina In October 2022</h2></span><p>NEW YORK, NEW YORK - OCTOBER 15: Cesar Pina and Jenni Tips attend Bravocon After Hours at Brooklyn Chop House on October 15, 2022 in New York City.

"Pina exploited celebrity status and social media to develop a devoted following of potential victims,” Philip R. Sellinger, U.S. Attorney, stated. “[He promised] returns that were too good to be true, [and] Pina allegedly <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">defrauded dozens of people of millions of dollars</a>." While DJ Envy avoided criminal charges despite some lawsuits, it seems like consequences will be much harder to avoid for the supposed main string-puller.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Meanwhile, The Breakfast Club's host is <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">still listed as a codefendant in this case</a>. As such, it's unclear exactly how the rest of this court proceeding will play out in terms of who should really be held accountable. But it's been a long case so far, so we aren't anticipating any easy fixes.
