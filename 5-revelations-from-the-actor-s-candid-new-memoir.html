Among them:</p><p><strong>1. He has a history with drugs.</strong> Garner writes that he smoked pot for most of his adult life and even did a little cocaine with <strong>John Belushi.</strong></p><p><strong>2. He’s ultra-political. </strong>He calls himself a “bleeding-heart liberal” who considers <strong>Adlai Stevenson</strong> the most intelligent man to have run for president, with <strong>Barack Obama</strong> a close second.</p><p><strong>3. He has strong opinions about his fellow actors, and not all positive. </strong>Garner calls his friend<strong> Steve McQueen</strong> an insecure poseur and not much of an actor. He labels <strong>Charles Bronson,</strong> another co-star from the 1963 movie The Great Escape, bitter and belligerent.</p><p><strong>4. He rates only two of his movies as excellent. </strong>He gives high praise to The Americanization of Emily and The Notebook. Of the anti-war drama Emily, he writes: “Audiences have come around to it, and it’s now a cult favorite and a minor classic. Unfortunately, it hasn’t put war out of style.” He also considers Grand Prix and Murphy’s Romance pretty good, but the rest of his movies he considers only average or even just plain awful.</p><p><strong>5. He got into acting by accident. </strong>While working at a Shell station, Garner met a soda jerk who told him that his good looks could make him a big star. After serving in Korea, he came back to find out that the soda jerk was a stage producer, gave him a non-speaking role in the stage production of The Caine Mutiny Court Martial, where he learned how to act by watching <strong>Henry Fonda </strong>night after night.</p><p>The book, from Simon & Schuster, is 282 pages and retails for $25.99.</p><p>The Associated Press contributed to this report.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue9OvZq2uXaOyuL%2BOo5imnaNitKK%2BzZ6pZqWVoryqvoymmK%2Bdop6wrHnRqJqknp%2BnsW6yyKWcrGViaoNygZZo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-peter-fornetti-wiki-age-bio-net-worth-career-relationship-family.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Peter Fornetti?
