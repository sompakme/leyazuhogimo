The Australian model's latest outing in Paris was certainly no exception. She was recently spotted heading out to a local hotspot, stunning in yet another nude-colored fit. It consisted of pants with suspender-like straps covering her chest and <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">left little to the imagination</a>.

She was seen wearing something similar earlier this week. It appears as though she and her husband <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Kanye West</a> are in town for Paris Fashion Week, and they stepped out for the Prototypes Menswear Spring/Summer 2025 runway show yesterday. Aside from the unexpected hairdo, she sported a <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">curve-hugging sheer bodysuit</a> and a pair of knee-high sock heels.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-bianca-censori-goes-solo-in-paris>Bianca Censori Goes Solo In Paris</h2></span><p>Kanye West and Bianca Censori attends the Marni fashion show during the Milan Fashion Week Womenswear Fall/Winter 2024-2025 on February 23, 2024 in Milan, Italy.

He opted to keep everything under wraps the last time he was photographed, however. At the runway show, he rocked an all-white outfit complete with a full face covering, gloves, and even a hood.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Censori's most recent outfit is a bit of a departure from her typical looks, though it doesn't necessarily come as a surprise. She usually prefers to show at least a little bit of skin and might have just grown tired of her usual nude bodysuits. What do you think of Bianca Censori's latest <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">scandalous look</a>? Are you a fan?
