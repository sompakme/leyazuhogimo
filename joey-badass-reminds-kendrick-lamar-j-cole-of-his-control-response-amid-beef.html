Cole</a>, and <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Drake</a> is ramping up now following Cole's "<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">7 Minute Drill</a>" response to the former TDE MC's disses. However, while this whole situation has folks remembering Kendrick's callout of other rappers on <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Big Sean</a>'s "Control" a decade ago, not enough people are remembering how these lyricists responded to him back then. At least, that's what Joey Badass thinks, as he took to Twitter on Friday (April 5) after the Dreamville boss' diss dropped with a simple message: "Never Forget," and a link to his "Killuminati Pt. 2" song's lyrics. On this song, he responded to Kendrick's "Control" shots with a lot of hunger, aggression, and boastfulness.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"No escaping, you in a swimming pool of champagne," Joey Bada$$ rapped against Kendrick Lamar on the Knwledge-produced track about 11 years ago. "You set yourself up for that one, mane / The King of New York? Ha! We ain’t just gon’ let that one hang." This seemed to be a direct address when it comes to J. Cole and Drake <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">beefing with Kendrick right now</a>, and in particular how folks are only keeping this debate to "The Big Three." As such, it seems like the New York spitter is opening it up to the entire rap game, and to names like his who fans might be overlooking right now in the face of "Like That" and "7 Minute Drill."</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-joey-badass-seems-to-throw-his-hat-into-kendrick-lamar-amp-j-cole-s-ring>Joey Badass Seems To Throw His Hat Into Kendrick Lamar & J. Cole's Ring</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Of course, Joey Bada$$ and Kendrick Lamar have shown each other a lot of respect and love over the years despite this competitive attitude. Still, this is pretty interesting since Kendrick never explicitly named Joey in his "Control" verse, yet naming himself the King of New York clearly and rightfully struck a nerve with the <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Pro Era</a> boss. For now, at least, it seems like the general hip-hop community will <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">keep this beef to "The Big Three,"</a> but there's still plenty of room to debate whether folks like Joey should replace one of them in conversations. Might this be a prelude to him making this a full-on lyrical attack, throwing his hat into the ring?</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">That seems unlikely, but it would certainly be pretty incendiary. As <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">more reactions to "7 Minute Drill" pour in</a>, folks will likely continue to bring up other rappers in this debate. But let's not act like this is the culmination of 11 years of silence; MCs have been challenging K.Dot for the throne for a while.

Cole, stay posted on HNHH.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Gabriel Bras Nevares is a music and pop culture news writer for HotNewHipHop.

Before working at HotNewHipHop, Gabriel produced multiple short documentaries, artist interviews, venue spotlights, and audio podcasts on a variety of genres and musical figures. Hardcore punk and Go-go music defined much of his coverage during his time at the George Washington University in D.C.
