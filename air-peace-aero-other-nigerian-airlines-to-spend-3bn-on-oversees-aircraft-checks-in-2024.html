forex woes</h2><p class=align-left>According to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">ThisDay</a>, several operational airlines are considering closing certain routes to focus on more profitable ones as they grapple with a continual reduction in active aircraft.</p><p class=align-left>The depreciation of the naira has significantly escalated maintenance costs, compelling airlines that generate revenue in the local <a href=#>currency</a> to allocate over 200% more funds than what was spent in 2015 for equivalent overseas aircraft maintenance expenses.</p><p class=align-left>According to James Ominyi, Head of Aero Contractors Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul (MRO) Division, airlines are grappling with a significant hurdle related to the substantial expenses incurred in aircraft maintenance abroad.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center

project</span></p></a><p class=align-left>He highlighted that the depreciation of the <a href=#>naira</a> and the scarcity of foreign exchange have rendered it exceptionally challenging to afford the costs of conducting extensive checks outside the country.</p><p class=align-left>Omoniyi said:</p>“It is really difficult because an airline may budget about $300, 000 for C-check but when the aircraft is opened up, there could be more work to be done and the cost of maintaining will skyrocket to about $1 million, which is equivalent to about N1.3 billion at the moment and about N350 million in 2015.”<p class=align-left>Nigeria currently has two maintenance facilities for scheduled commercial aircraft: Aero Contractors and 7Star.</p><p class=align-left>However, these facilities face limitations in maintaining all categories of aircraft within the country's airline fleet, encompassing Bombardier, Embraer, Boeing, Airbus, and others.</p><p class=align-left>Ominyi noted that numerous airlines have downsized their fleets because the grounded aircraft cannot undergo maintenance locally, primarily due to the absence of foreign exchange to facilitate their removal and cover the costs of necessary checks.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center

regarding determining suitable locations to maintain their aircraft.</p><p class=align-left>They explore avenues such as sourcing foreign exchange through banks to address this issue. Ominyi mentioned that some airlines have made payments in naira to the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) through their banks, awaiting the allocation of foreign exchange.</p><p class=align-left>Also speaking on the matter, Haruna Abdullahi, told <strong>Legit.ng</strong> that Nigerian airlines stand to benefit significantly if a majority of the aircraft in their fleet undergo maintenance locally.</p><p class=align-left>He said:</p>If the equipment and facilities were available in Nigeria, this would have saved airlines the cost of going abroad for these services. This approach would not only result in cost savings in logistics but, more importantly, alleviate the pressure on them to acquire dollars before conducting necessary maintenance on their aircraft.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/6ac2e2bb19fafb3c.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Travel agents speak on low airfare after CBN clears foreign airlines trapped funds</span></p></a><h2>FG moves to slash airlines' airfares by 50%</h2><p class=align-left>In related news, <a href=#><strong>Legit.ng</strong> reported </a>that the government is actively pursuing measures to alleviate the financial burden on airlines in the country by considering subsidies to reduce the soaring costs of air travel.</p><p class=align-left>In a meeting held on Friday, December 15, 2023, Festus Keyamo, the Minister of Aviation and Aerospace Development, engaged with the Airline Operators of Nigeria (AON) to discuss potential strategies.</p><p class=align-left>According to reports, a proposal was outlined where the airline would provide passengers with a form during travel, and other processes would follow.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkr7a%2FyKecrKtdmrCwus6msGihnpnCtMDRsmZqbWdrhXmEjJqgq2Wgmq6ksYymmLFlkZ6%2FbrrIoJyroZGjeqK10aWgp52jYsCxsc2dZGyanmK8t7HRrJyeq12WtrOv0ZqdrWWTnbKkt9JmaWlqZGQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-karissa-staples-dating-now-everything-you-need-to-know.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Karissa Staples Dating Now?
