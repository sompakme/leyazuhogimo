According to the <a href=#>New York Post</a>, the terrified passenger in everyone's fave viral video is a woman named Tiffany Gomes. The outlet uncovered Gomes' identity by sorting through police records that were filed following the incident. According to the report, Gomes was in the process of confronting her relatives over Airpods that she believed they had stolen before claiming "the aircraft was not safe" and she didn't believe it would "make it to its destination." The paperwork also stated that, despite Gomes' hysteria, she attempted to reboard the plane, which had been evacuated.</p><p>So, what does Gomes do? Well, she's apparently a marketing executive who makes money enough to afford a $2 million house in an upscale Texas neighborhood. We don't know if this makes the story more puzzling or less. However, at least one person will be happy with this revelation. On July 12, roughly 10 days after the incident, one Twitter user <a href=#>tweeted</a>, "I find it uncanny that the internet has found every Karen who's ever lived, yet, no one has been able to identify the lady who saw the mf that is not real." The tweet racked has since racked up over 230,000 likes and 18,000 retweets.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamtmZn93gI6wpqaZnmLDqr7ApWSppJGjsm65xKWrnaeno3qmxMScZKudkaF6rbXFnmY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./which-gta-online-car-is-based-on-lotus-evija-in-new-last-dose-update.html><span>←</span><span>Which GTA Online car is based on Lotus Evija in new Last Dose update</span></a>
