A recent statement about Thunder Rosa was taken in a way that she didn’t intend it, and now she’s setting the record straight by blaming the fans.</p><p>In case you didn’t know, while<a href=#> speaking to SLAM Wrestling</a>, Britt Baker questioned Thunder Rosa’s passion for pro wrestling. Those comments went viral, and it sparked a bit of fury among those vocal detractors of AEW.</p><p>“I stand by everything I said because I still have the same questions… You are traveling all over the place for other projects but you’re not coming work where you are the champion? I have that question. I want to know why. I am just asking that question because I’m very passionate and protective of AEW.</p><p>Anyone can call me a bully but I stand by that and that question still hasn’t been answered to this day. People like Adam Cole would have killed to be able to come to work but he cannot travel. It is not like he was going in and doing a signing or convention or a seminar. They’re not coming to work but he wasn’t able to even leave the house.”</p><p>While speaking to<a href=#> Busted Open Radio</a>, Britt Baker had something to say about the backlash she received. Baker said that fans twisted her words, and they took it in a direction that she did not intend.</p><p>It’s just like on Twitter, people twist and turn your words and say that you said something that you didn’t. All I did on the show was ask, if she’s able to travel and she’s traveling all over the place, and she’s going on Busted Open every week saying ‘I’m still the champion,’ why can’t you come to work? Why can’t you come cut a promo? Why can’t you come do commentary or come say hi to the locker room? Kris Statlander has had her knees blown out for over a year and she’s there every single week. I have a very workhorse mentality where I want to be at work.</p><p>As soon as I’m done with Dynamite, I get on a plane and go to the dental office. I can’t relate to that mentality of where you don’t want to be at work, where you tell everyone you’re the champion. I’ll be honest, I’ve asked her that same question twice and she doesn’t have an answer for me either. It’s not that I want her to work hurt or that I don’t believe in her injury.</p><p>There is none of that. Just, why? Why not come to the locker room where you’re the champion, when you can. You have people like Adam Cole, who couldn’t travel, who couldn’t leave the house for weeks. It was a huge milestone when he could take a walk up and down the street with his head injury. That is what I don’t understand. People don’t have to agree, that’s fine. I’m a bold and stubborn individual and I stand by what I said.</p><p>Thunder Rosa’s immediate return to the ring isn’t happening. She recently stated that she won’t be back for a while. Although Rosa is still healing, she will still appear on AEW television as part of the AEW Spanish commentary team.</p><p>We’ll have to see what happens in the future, but Britt Baker and Thunder Rosa might have unfinished business. Keep checking back with <a href=#>Ringside News</a> for more.</p><p>What’s your take on this situation between Thunder Rosa and Britt Baker? Do you want to see them wrestle again?
