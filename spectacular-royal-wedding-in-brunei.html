Over 2,000 guests were on hand to see the 30-year-old make his vows at the royal palace in Bandar Seri Begawan.

The British royal family was also represented, by the Duke of Gloucester.</p><p id=e3pqfe1l2iJIK data-wc=69>The groom wore a gold crown and a traditional snake-bladed dagger for the ceremony, while his bride was dressed in a blaze of blue and gold. Her glittering Malay outfit was accessorised with drop earrings with diamonds the size of olives and topped by a sparkling tiara. After the service, which was conducted by a senior Islamic cleric, the couple kissed the Sultan's hand as they received his blessing.</p><p id=e626GVeYJCMyb data-wc=53>Afterwards the newlyweds made their way through the capital in a gold, open-topped Rolls-Royce. Thousands of well-wishers lined the streets as their car, which was followed by over 100 limousines, crawled through the city. The festivities will continue throughout Friday, when the Sultan hosts a huge feast in the palace's 4,000-seat banquet hall.</p><p id=efY8L-dvFX8H data-wc=15>Crown Prince Al-Muhtadee met his young bride, whose mother is Swiss, though a mutual friend.</p><p id=eRGeJww8pt><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/legacy/royalty/2004/09/09/bruneiwedding/imgs/bruneiwedding-dop1a.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p id=eP4iF5Rmmzt data-wc=3>Photo: © Alphapress.com</p><p id=eUf4aKfWyH data-wc=25>The prince with his 17-year-old student bride.
