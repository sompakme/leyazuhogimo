Fans are already having fun with that.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The exchange begins with what looks to be Prince sending a crying emoji to Future, then the rapper responds, "Tell your mom." The child responds, "Tell my mom what" and Future replies, "Buy u some clothes." After Prince writes "Dad," the rapper looks to reply, "Your mom is a hoe!" Fans aren't convinced that it was truly Future behind the messages.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Brittni shared another screenshot of the name-calling text and added, "Child Abuse" to another slide on her Story. Some people pointed out that she deleted the post that showed the phone number and changed the name to "Dad1." Future hasn't addressed this controversy, but this isn't the first time these two have gone at it.&nbsp;</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Erika Marie is a seasoned journalist, editor, and ghostwriter who works predominantly in the fields of music, spirituality, mental health advocacy, and social activism.
