According to<a href=#>&nbsp;Newsweek</a>, the Bunk'd star prepared a foxtrot to the John Legend song "Ordinary People" in Boyce's honor. It's unclear if that dance will get her through to the next round, but what is clear is the powerful relationship she shared with her Jesse co-star.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma21mboJ0e9OhnGasoqrBqXnAm6aurF2ouKK1jKOYnKOjpLturc2dZJyZnZq%2FsLqMm6aym5WoerOxy5qroqeeqLWqvI4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rose-bertram-ethnicity-nationality-race-family-body-measurements-career.html><span>←</span><span>Rose Bertram Ethnicity, Nationality, Race, Family, Body measurements, career</span></a>
