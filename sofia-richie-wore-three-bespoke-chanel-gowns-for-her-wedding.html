This included her 'something blue' – the couple's initials and the wedding date – which were sewn into the inner lining of the dress. The gown also featured a heart design in the lace in the middle of her chest, and another heart below, facing it; a hidden motif representing their love. Richie paired the dress with a dramatic veil, an elegant updo and a pair of diamond earrings.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I want to thank Virginie, Olivia, and all of my Chanel family for helping make my wedding dress so special," Richie wrote on Instagram. "I felt like a princess, and I will forever be grateful for them and this experience."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She added: "I always had this vision of the big princess dress and going big, but as I got older, I realised that I wanted something a bit more simple... Maybe ‘simple’ isn’t the right word because my dress definitely is not simple!"</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Later in the evening, the bride changed into a more party-appropriate ensemble. She wore a mini-dress inspired by a Nineties Chanel design previously worn by Claudia Schiffer on the catwalk. It was structured and featured the iconic Chanel flower, the camellia. She teamed it with low-heeled white shoes, to dance the night away in.</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The third bespoke Chanel dress that Richie wore was for her rehearsal dinner the night before the wedding, which was just as beautifully detailed. The gown was sleeved and ankle-length, featuring a high neck and a fringed overlay skirt, and was covered in beautiful white beading. It was inspired by a dress worn by Stella Tennant on the autumn/winter 1997 couture catwalk.</p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for Inside the atelier: Chanel Couture autumn/winter 2020 part one" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/e5804a07-b407-46f0-a530-c51a5b6d7c6f/thumb_1920x1080_00002_1594308310_71236.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The happy couple tied the knot in front of a star-studded crowd, which of course included her famous family: her father, the singer Lionel Richie, and her sister, Nicole Richie. Other A-list attendees included family friends Cameron Diaz and Paris Hilton. The guests shared plenty of images across social media, gushing about the perfect day and the wonderful union, while Richie debuted her new double-barrelled name on her brand new TikTok account, where she shared various videos from the wedding weekend, including her getting-ready process.</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhwrsCzmJqqXZe%2FqrDErGaabGNrhXKDk21mrKeWnq5uvsicn6KdXayypbDIp55mnKKawLR7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./shawn-michaels-2023-wealth-what-is-the-wrestling-icon-s-current-net-worth-sarkariresult.html><span>←</span><span>Shawn Michaels' 2023 Wealth: What Is the Wrestling Icon's Current Net Worth? - SarkariResult</span></a>
