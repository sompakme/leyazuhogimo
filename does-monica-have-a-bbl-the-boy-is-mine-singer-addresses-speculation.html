Most of our favourite rap divas have undergone plastic surgery procedures to physically enhance themselves, be it breast augmentations, butt injections, or tummy tucks. Of course, each individual is free to do what they want with their body, but dishonesty about what's natural and what's fake has left a bad taste in some fan's mouths. Presently, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">BBLs are so popular</a> that the internet seems to have a hard time discerning who's gone under the knife, and who's been in the gym. Genre-bending artist <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Monica</a> is the latest to be flooded with accusations of getting her body done, which she openly addressed on social media.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">As AllHipHop reports, "The Boy Is Mine" hitmaker graced the stage at Tycoon Music Festival in Atlanta last week (February 13).

"Let me tell you something. My health is far too bad to be playing like that. For me a BBL would mean bought by Linda," Monica added, referencing her stylist's ability to make her figure look effortlessly snatched. "Mama don’t play! I won’t even get lash extensions; I still wear strips I can rip off. I done kept it real with y’all so long y’all forgot."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Before she was allowed to join <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Nicki Minaj</a> on her upcoming tour, Monica candidly expressed online that she felt forgotten by the music industry.
