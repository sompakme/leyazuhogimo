What is this?

You need to understand that this plant tends to grow very quickly as long as you provide it with appropriate amounts of care and nutrients.<h2>How far apart should you plant lavender?</h2>Plant lavender 2 to 3 feet apart. Plants typically reach between 1 and 3 feet in height. Add mulch (rock or pea gravel work particularly well) to keep weeds to a minimum. Keep the mulch away from the crown of the lavender plant, however, to prevent excess moisture and root rot.<h2>Do rosemary and lavender grow well together?</h2>Can rosemary and lavender be planted together? Yes. Both rosemary and lavender are Mediterranean herbs that require similar conditions for both sun and watering.<h2>Can you plant hydrangeas with lavender?</h2>Similarly, plants that prefer dry or poor quality soil, such as lavenders, will not grow well with hydrangeas, no matter how pretty the flowers look together.<h2>Can I plant marigolds with lavender?</h2>Lavender companion plants include flowers that, like lavender, enjoy full sun and well-drained soil such as marigolds, zinnias and certain types of daisies.<h2>Are bees attracted to lavender?</h2>If you are a lavender lover and grower, you have discovered that if bees are nearby, they love lavender in bloom. Lavender and bees are, simply put, very good friends!<h2>Does lavender need full sun?</h2>Growing lavender is easy and rewarding. Lavender can be grown in garden beds or in pots. To grow lavender successfully it needs well-drained soil and full sun. In arid climates lavender grows well as a perennial, but in humid climates it is often grown as an annual.<h2>What is rosemary a good companion plant for?</h2>Any plant in the cabbage family, like broccoli, cauliflower and kale, can benefit from having rosemary nearby. Rosemary in proximity will prevent the rampant feeding of the larvae of these moths. It will also increase yields on carrots and beans by repelling certain beetles and carrot flies.<h2>What happens if you plant lavender too close together?</h2>If you plant lavenders closer the 2 feet away from one another or near other plants they will cast shade on one another (particularly the larger varieties which can reach up to 40 inches in height) Sunlight is one of the most important growing conditions for lavender so it is imperative that you plant them far enough ...<h2>What happens if you don't prune lavender?</h2>An annual pruning is an important step for long-lasting lavender (Lavandula spp. and hybrids) plants. Without it they grow a large, lanky, woody base that can split open — it looks bad and shortens the plant's lifespan.<h2>Should lavender be cut back?</h2>Lavender bushes need to be cut back every year to keep them from growing out of control. “Pruning lavender keeps it looking full, encourages new growth and flowering, and gives you lots of fresh tips to harvest throughout the season,” says Amy Fedele, a home gardening expert and Pretty Purple Door blogger.<h2>What time of year should you plant lavender?</h2>Plant lavender in spring, once all chances of frost have passed. This beautiful, fragrant herb is a great addition to raised beds, in-ground gardens, and growing in containers. Space lavender plants 12 to 18 inches apart in an area with plenty of sunlight and sandy, well-drained soil with a pH of 6.7 to 7.3.<h2>Does lavender keep bugs away?</h2>Lavender.<p>They love the flowers, but other bugs stay away. Lavender has a pleasant scent that comes from the essential oils in the leaves of the plant, but the bugs hate it. Hang some dried lavender in your closet and you won't have to worry about moths eating your clothes.</p><h2>Does lavender need lots of water?</h2>Lavender is drought-tolerant, which means mature plants don't need to be watered all the time like your other garden plants. Too much water can leave them susceptible to root rot and fungal disease. Young, newly planted lavender does need regular watering until established (either by irrigation or adequate rainfall).<h2>How long does a lavender plant last?</h2>Lavender is a perennial and has been known to survive up to 15 years in home gardens. Longevity can be increase through many methods of lavender growing. Soil preparation, soil amendments, drainage, pruning, winter protection and proper harvesting can result in a life long lavender hedge.<h2>How do you stop lavender going woody?</h2>Preventing Woody Lavender<p>Plant your lavender in well-drained, rocky soil, on a slope (if possible) to ensure drainage. Fertilize them lightly the very first year after planting. After that, do not fertilize regularly. Prune lavender lightly to maintain the rounded shape.</p><h2>How do you cover lavender for winter?</h2>If you don't get a good reliable snow cover, cover your plant bases with a well draining mulch, such as pea gravel, and/or cover the plant itself with a breathable fabric cover (like burlap or gardening blanket fabric), to protect from wind and freezing temperatures.<h2>Is lavender OK in shade?</h2>No, ideally it's best that all types of lavender are exposed to full sun for most of the day. Hardier varieties (Hidcote and Grosso) may survive but it's best to find a sunny spot to plant them in.<h2>Is lavender toxic to dogs?</h2>The lavender plant contains a compound called linalool, which can be toxic to animals like dogs and cats.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye8isZKWZppq7pbHRZphmn5%2BksW6vzqanmqaZpLtuvMuapa0%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./i-was-fired-from-a-hit-show-and-intimidated-by-lawyers-guest-column.html><span>←</span><span>I Was Fired from a Hit Show and Intimidated By Lawyers (Guest Column)</span></a>
