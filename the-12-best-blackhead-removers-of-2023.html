All that pressure and picking is going to leave your skin scratched up, irritated, and quite frankly, not looking any better. You’re much better off shrinking the appearance of your pores by using one of the best blackhead removers. From <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/g32629018/best-chemical-peels-at-home/>chemical exfoliants</a> and physical scrubs to <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/g33003533/best-pore-cleanser-vacuum/>pore vacuums</a>, there’s no shortage of products to help ~safely~ clear out the dead skin, oil, and bacteria clogging up your skin. And by using one of these blackhead removal products (we’re rounding up the best of the best below), you’ll likely have fewer comedones from here on out.&nbsp;</p><p>But picking a blackhead removal product isn’t one-size-fits-all. A pretty intense <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/a34954102/what-does-salicylic-acid-do/>salicylic acid</a> serum might work wonders for someone with uber-oily skin, while a gentler alpha-hydroxy acid (think: lactic or <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/glycolic-acid-benefits/>glycolic acid</a>) will do the job for those with more sensitive skin types. Regardless of what you need, we’ve got you covered.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-what-are-blackheads><span>What Are Blackheads?</span></h2><p>A blackhead is quite literally a pimple, specifically an open comedone, that has come to a black-colored head. “They are a type of acne lesion in which a pore accumulates dead skin, oil, and bacteria,” explains board-certified dermatologist <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.mdcsnyc.com/provider/brendan-camp-md referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Dr. Brendan Camp</a>. They then turn black as a result of oxidation. Blackheads are going to be the *most* common in people with oily skin, but just about anyone can deal with ‘em. You can have sensitive skin and blackheads, dry skin and blackheads, combination skin and blackheads—you get the point.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-what-to-look-for><span>What to Look For</span></h2><p>“Blackhead treatments can come as cleansers, toners, serums, or leave-on treatments,” explains Dr. Camp. “Some <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/best-face-masks/>facial masks</a> can also be used to draw out impurities on the skin to clean out pores.” Then there’s also <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/g33003533/best-pore-cleanser-vacuum/>pore vacuums,</a><a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/best-pore-strips/> pore strips,</a> and physical scrubs. In short: There’s a lot to choose from. But, the best blackhead remover for you is going to depend largely on your skin type. “People with more sensitive skin may elect to use a chemical exfoliant, as they tend to be more gentle on the skin than physical exfoliants,” says Dr. Camp. Lactic acid, glycolic acid, or poly-hydroxy acids can provide non-abrasive exfoliation. Now while those ingredients are all very, very viable options for oily or combination skin types, too, products with salicylic acid, scrubs, retinoids, or pore vacuums, are also an option.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-how-blackhead-removers-work><span>How Blackhead Removers Work</span></h2><p>How your blackhead remover works is pretty dependent on the type of product you choose. Pore strips, for example, are going to use an adhesive material to grip dead skin and debris, while pore vacuums use suction to achieve the same end. Then there’s more traditional exfoliation. “Chemical exfoliants use ingredients that break apart adhesions between superficial skin cells to gently remove dead skin,” says Dr. Camp. “Physical exfoliants gently abrade the skin to scour away dead skin cells and debris.”&nbsp;</p><h3 class=article-body__section id=section-the-best-blackhead-removers><span>The Best Blackhead Removers</span></h3><a href=# data-model-name="Dr. Dennis Gross Alpha Beta Universal Daily Peel" data-url=https://www.sephora.com/product/alpha-beta-universal-daily-peel-P377533 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url="https://shop-links.co/link?publisher_slug=future&exclusive=1&u1=hawk-custom-tracking&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Falpha-beta-universal-daily-peel-P377533&article_name=hawk-article-name&article_url=hawk-article-url" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name=sephora.com data-merchant-id=204077 data-merchant-url=sephora.com data-merchant-network=Generic readability=1><p class=vanilla-image-block data-bordeaux-image-check><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WoBacMLQ2iFkGxiFcQsm4-1920-80.png><span class="featured__label horizontal__label">The Best Peel Pad Blackhead Remover</span></p></a><p>Dr. Dennis Gross Alpha Beta Universal Daily Peel</p><p>We simply can’t talk about the best blackhead removers without going on a little tangent about these uber-popular peels. They’re a derm-favorite (Dr. Camp approves), a beauty editor must-have, and loved by celebrities ranging from Selena Gomez to Kim Kardashian. It’s no surprise they have a cult-favorite status—they work like a charm. “They contain alpha and beta-hydroxy acids to remove superficial dead skin cells and impurities within pores,” explains Dr. Camp. The combo of acids allows them to not only <a href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/a20748387/how-to-unclog-pores/>clean your pores,</a> but also provide a ton of other benefits.

It “regulates cell turnover,” which means there’s a lesser chance of your pores getting clogged up with dead skin cells. But that’s just the tip of the good skin iceberg.

The thought of physical abrasion was a bit, well, terrifying—especially for easily irritated skin types. But fast forward to 2023 and there are actually some really elegant, non-abrasive scrubs on the market. One of the best, in my humble opinion, is from Dr. Barbara Sturm. The physical component removes flakes and dry skin patches, which are all the more common in the winter, while purslane and vitamin A soothe the skin and combat redness.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Physical and chemical exfoliation; Soothing&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>Not as strong as a daily leave-on</p><p><strong>Customer Review: </strong>"I use the enzyme cleanser every few days as it works as a light scrub but this one is wonderful for times when I feel I need something deeper.

Still, I want results. That’s where this one-minute mask comes in. It works quite literally in 60 seconds, but delivers some of the most dramatic results I’ve ever experienced. It tightens pores, gets rid of dead skin cells, and when I use it regularly, gives me a clearer complexion overall. The texture is a little unique though. It comes out of the bottle as a powder and is then activated by water. With a little rubbing, it works into a cream.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Fast-acting; Clarifying&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Expensive&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Customer Review: </strong>"I have some cyclical redness on my cheeks and have to be careful with too much acid in exfoliators, this product is amazing at getting rid of dry surface skin w/o causing irritation.

It’s easy to see why: The peel is composed of a super-powered blend of acids. AHAs, namely glycolic acid, come together with BHAs, namely salicylic acid, to reveal a de-clogged, clearer complexion in a matter of minutes. You’ll also notice a smoother, softer complexion and more even tone. While the results are pretty unbelievable, please proceed with caution. This stuff is strong and should not be used on sensitive or easily irritated skin.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Powerful; Helps with skin texture</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>Not for sensitive skin&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Customer Review: </strong>"Not a must, but a nice addition to refresh and revitalize the appearance of your skin. Don't be alarmed by the 'burn' when you apply it, nor the initial redness when you first wash it off. Adhere to the timing (minimize if necessary for the first few applications) Moisturize your damp skin with a hyaluronic acid-based moisturizer immediately afterwards and this will reveal the gorgeous glass-like skin this product is sure to deliver. Bottle lasts forever as you don't need much product, and you use it infrequently (1/wk or 1/every few weeks) anyway!" -Sephora</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-meet-the-dermatologist><span>Meet the Dermatologist</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WoBacMLQ2iFkGxiFcQsm4-1920-80.png><span class=person__name>Dr. Brendan Camp</span><a class=button-social href=# aria-label=INSTAGRAM><span class=button-social__icon></span></a><a class=button-social href=# aria-label=WEBSITE><span class="button-social__icon button-social__icon-website"></span></a>Board-Certified Dermatologist<p>Brendan Camp, MD, is double board-certified in dermatology and dermatopathology and sees patients at MDCS Dermatology: Medical Dermatology & Cosmetic Surgery, which has locations in Upper East Side, Hampton Bays, Commack, Smithtown, Plainview, and Midtown East of Manhattan, New York.
