Trust us: The Marie Claire team has spent the past few weeks testing curling irons to discover the best, evaluating ease of use, versatility, hair health benefits, and durability of the curl. Our honest reviews, ahead.</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-what-to-look-for-in-a-curling-iron><span>What to Look For in a Curling Iron</span></h2><p>“The smaller the barrel the tighter the curl,” says Rubenstein. A one-inch iron, according to Josh, will create tighter curls, while a two-inch barrel will give you more of a wavy style. Just a word from the wise: If your hair isn’t great at holding a curl, go tighter…it’s going to drop throughout the day.</p><p>As a rule of thumb, the lower the heat is, the less damage you will have. But, it’s impossible to say that 350 degrees is the ideal temperature across the board. “If you have frizzy, thick, or coarse hair you will need a higher heat,” explains Rubenstein. “If you can do a curl or wave in one pass you can raise the heat—I believe this causes less mechanical damage. If you have to do multiple passes to the same section to get the result, you want to lower the heat.”</p><p>If you don't want to put heat on your hair, try one of the <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/overnight-heatless-curls/>best overnight heatless curls</a> tools.</p><p>There are three main types of curling irons: A marcel curling iron, a spring curling iron, and a curling wand—all of which create different types of curls. “Marcel and spring clamps will create more traditional, tighter curls,” says Josh. A wand, on the other hand? “It gives more of a beachy undone wave,” says Rubenstein.</p><p>Most curling irons will either be made of tourmaline or ceramic. "Tourmaline curling irons are coated with or infused with tourmaline, a gemstone that emits negative ions and infrared heat. This helps reduce frizz and static, resulting in shinier, smoother curls and is particularly effective for thick or coarse hair," explains Cavalcante. "Ceramic curling irons feature ceramic plates or barrels that provide even heat distribution, minimizing damage and creating consistent curls. They help smooth the hair cuticle, enhancing shine and reducing frizz, making them suitable for fine to normal hair types."</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-the-best-curling-irons><span>The Best Curling Irons</span></h2><a href=# data-model-name="T3 Singlepass 1.25-Inch Curling Iron " data-url="https://www.sephora.com/product/singlepass-curl-1-25-professional-curling-iron-P428229?country_switch=us&lang=en&skuId=2045755&om_mmc=ppc-GG_18529129158_145040101111_pla-1963373331101_2045755_626692864002_9060351_c&gclid=Cj0KCQjw_r6hBhDdARIsAMIDhV_fu00PHdMJF06SY_s86XbDPmQoGSDUDy6mDIiUhJfjc6lg7LAfqg4aAiK9EALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url="https://shop-links.co/link?country_switch=us&lang=en&skuId=2045755&om_mmc=ppc-GG_18529129158_145040101111_pla-1963373331101_2045755_626692864002_9060351_c&gclid=Cj0KCQjw_r6hBhDdARIsAMIDhV_fu00PHdMJF06SY_s86XbDPmQoGSDUDy6mDIiUhJfjc6lg7LAfqg4aAiK9EALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds&publisher_slug=future&exclusive=1&u1=hawk-custom-tracking&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fsinglepass-curl-1-25-professional-curling-iron-P428229%3Fcountry_switch%3Dus%26lang%3Den%26skuId%3D2045755%26om_mmc%3Dppc-GG_18529129158_145040101111_pla-1963373331101_2045755_626692864002_9060351_c%26gclid%3DCj0KCQjw_r6hBhDdARIsAMIDhV_fu00PHdMJF06SY_s86XbDPmQoGSDUDy6mDIiUhJfjc6lg7LAfqg4aAiK9EALw_wcB%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds&article_name=hawk-article-name&article_url=hawk-article-url" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name=sephora.com data-merchant-id=204077 data-merchant-url=sephora.com data-merchant-network=Generic readability=1><p class=vanilla-image-block data-bordeaux-image-check><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3zpZ4gNXDxV4koMxbbY3na-1920-80.png><span class="featured__label horizontal__label">Best Curling Iron Overall</span></p></a><p>T3 Singlepass 1.25-Inch Curling Iron</p><p>With nine different heat settings ranging from 260 to 510 degrees, this curling iron allows you to pick the best temperature for your hair type and texture. That way, you’ll be able to achieve a long-lasting curl—in just one pass—without frying your ends. The brand’s ceramic composition also helps prevent tugging and pulling; your hair will glide gently through the clamp, resulting in a smooth, shiny curl. Plus, the barrel is extra long (14.5 inches), making this long hair-friendly.</p><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Auto shut off after an hour; under $150; nine heat settings depending on your hair type</p><p><strong>What We Don’t: </strong>The clamp sometimes catches hair and causes accidental breakage</p><p><strong>Material: </strong>Ceramic</p><p><strong>Temperature Range: </strong>260 to 510</p><p><strong>Barrel Size: </strong>1.25 inch</p><p><strong>Who It’s Good For: </strong>While this is technically good for all types of hair thanks to the nine different heat settings (fine hair should use one to four, medium hair should use five to six, and coarse hair should use seven to nine), the barrel is a bit too slippery for super fine hair.</p><p><strong>Our Review:</strong> “I’ve been on the hunt for a quality curling iron for quite some time now, so I was beyond excited to get my hands on the T3 SinglePass Curl Curling Iron. Prior to getting started with the styling process, I washed, blow-dried, and straightened my hair (for context, I have curly hair, so prepping my hair beforehand was an absolute must). Since I often try to avoid overheating my strands, I adjusted the temperature to the medium heat setting (350°F-370°F). I parted my hair and rolled the iron upwards toward my scalp, doing so section by section. The iron was super lightweight and easy to maneuver, which made styling a breeze. To my surprise, I only needed to run the tool through my hair once! I was able to achieve a defined and voluminous look within minutes. My only critique is that the curls didn’t last for as long as I had anticipated. That said, I probably should have used a higher heat setting to ensure a long-lasting hold.” — <a href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/author/lauren-tappan/>Lauren Tappan, Fashion Editor</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3zpZ4gNXDxV4koMxbbY3na-1920-80.png> <a href=# data-model-name="Dyson Airwap Multi-Styler Complete Long " data-url="https://www.sephora.com/product/sephora-exclusive-ceramic-pop-airwrap-tm-multi-styler-P507852?country_switch=us&lang=en&skuId=2718062&om_mmc=ppc-GG_20694559161___2718062__9067609_c&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiAg9urBhB_EiwAgw88mVFD9JgHQcAzQu4xAH7Nexhgh2udx786ycfpkYKOUJHDU_lnWdQrWBoC--oQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url="https://shop-links.co/link?country_switch=us&lang=en&skuId=2718062&om_mmc=ppc-GG_20694559161___2718062__9067609_c&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiAg9urBhB_EiwAgw88mVFD9JgHQcAzQu4xAH7Nexhgh2udx786ycfpkYKOUJHDU_lnWdQrWBoC--oQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds&publisher_slug=future&exclusive=1&u1=hawk-custom-tracking&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fsephora-exclusive-ceramic-pop-airwrap-tm-multi-styler-P507852%3Fcountry_switch%3Dus%26lang%3Den%26skuId%3D2718062%26om_mmc%3Dppc-GG_20694559161___2718062__9067609_c%26gad_source%3D1%26gclid%3DCjwKCAiAg9urBhB_EiwAgw88mVFD9JgHQcAzQu4xAH7Nexhgh2udx786ycfpkYKOUJHDU_lnWdQrWBoC--oQAvD_BwE%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds&article_name=hawk-article-name&article_url=hawk-article-url" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name=sephora.com data-merchant-id=204077 data-merchant-url=sephora.com data-merchant-network=Generic readability=1><p class=vanilla-image-block data-bordeaux-image-check><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VYQKPnJRUEJ7PpgFmGiUfb-1920-80.png><span class="featured__label horizontal__label">Best Curling Iron for Long Hair</span></p></a><p>Dyson AirWrap Multi-Styler Complete Long</p><p>The <a href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/dyson-airwrap-back-in-stock/><u>AirWrap is shockingly in stock</u></a> at the moment (can’t promise how long that’ll last), so don’t miss your chance to get the cult-favorite item. It comes with a handful of attachments that can do everything from rough-dry sopping wet hair and tame flyaways to provide a sleek, smooth finish. The star of the show, though, is the curling barrel, which uses controlled airflow to create voluminous, bouncy curls. There’s no technique necessary; just hold the barrel up to a strand of hair and let the Airwrap do the rest. For more info, check out my full review of the <a href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/new-dyson-airwrap-multi-styler-review/><u>AirWrap Multi-Styler</u></a>.</p><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Incredibly versatile thanks to six attachments; variations of the tool for straight/wavy and curly/coily hair with attachments suited to specific hair types; well-made and long-lasting tool</p><p><strong>What We Don’t: </strong>It's very expensive, and because of the wattage, you can’t use it internationally</p><p><strong>Material: </strong>Ceramic and steel with boar bristle and nylon brushes</p><p><strong>Temperature Range:</strong> 140 to 302</p><p><strong>Barrel Size:</strong> 1.2 inch or 1.6 inch</p><p><strong>Who It’s Good For: </strong>The Dyson Airwrap works for all hair types, but you will have better results if you select the tool that works best for you. There’s a straight-to-wavy version with smoothing brush attachments and a curly-to-coily version with a larger round brush, a diffuser, and a wide-tooth comb.</p><p><strong>Just a note: </strong>Those with thicker, coily, or curly hair may find Dyson’s results fleeting due to the low heat.</p><p><strong>Our Review: </strong>“My hair styling predating the Dyson required a blow dryer, a round brush, a straightening iron (can’t have frizz!), and a curling iron. This single tool does everything at once. I typically rough dry my hair with the Coanda smoothing dryer and then add volume with the round brush attachment. Sometimes, I’ll stop there; the round volumizing brush can create a soft curl and bouncy blowout. But when I want a more intense curl, the Airwrap 1.2 inch long barrel is my savior. I can curl my whole head in under five minutes. I just pick up chunks of my hair, let the tool spiral my hair, hold everything for 10 seconds, and release. It looks a bit crazy before I run my fingers through it. But once I work in some hair oil, I’m left with a blowout reminiscent of a ‘90s supermodel.” — <a href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/author/samantha-holender/>Samantha Holender, Beauty Editor</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/H4bjqx2eiBxgtN2xii4qaL-1920-80.png> <a href=# data-model-name="Drybar The Mixologist Interchangable Styling Iron " data-url="https://www.sephora.com/product/drybar-the-mixologist-interchangeable-styling-iron-P463035?country_switch=us&lang=en&skuId=2375301&om_mmc=ppc-GG_18532081624_142574898616_pla-1686905437189_2375301_626820665504_9060351_c&gclid=Cj0KCQjw_r6hBhDdARIsAMIDhV9SbfKHoaIBTBf13p-_G1tUzO3wLiYRxTkTDd_E7o44IQOqKymNfMEaAjIyEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url="https://shop-links.co/link?country_switch=us&lang=en&skuId=2375301&om_mmc=ppc-GG_18532081624_142574898616_pla-1686905437189_2375301_626820665504_9060351_c&gclid=Cj0KCQjw_r6hBhDdARIsAMIDhV9SbfKHoaIBTBf13p-_G1tUzO3wLiYRxTkTDd_E7o44IQOqKymNfMEaAjIyEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds&publisher_slug=future&exclusive=1&u1=hawk-custom-tracking&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fdrybar-the-mixologist-interchangeable-styling-iron-P463035%3Fcountry_switch%3Dus%26lang%3Den%26skuId%3D2375301%26om_mmc%3Dppc-GG_18532081624_142574898616_pla-1686905437189_2375301_626820665504_9060351_c%26gclid%3DCj0KCQjw_r6hBhDdARIsAMIDhV9SbfKHoaIBTBf13p-_G1tUzO3wLiYRxTkTDd_E7o44IQOqKymNfMEaAjIyEALw_wcB%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds&article_name=hawk-article-name&article_url=hawk-article-url" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name=sephora.com data-merchant-id=204077 data-merchant-url=sephora.com data-merchant-network=Generic readability=1><p class=vanilla-image-block data-bordeaux-image-check><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SBrQjxrY6Yed5umTFUKG7a-1920-80.png><span class="featured__label horizontal__label">Best Curling Iron for Thick Hair</span></p></a><p>Drybar The Mixologist Interchangable Styling Iron</p><p>Sure, this might be expensive, but trust me: It’s worth every penny. The tool is basically three tools in one. The bottom component stays steady, but you can swap the top attachment for a curling iron with a clamp, a curling wand, or a three-barrel crimper. So this multi-purpose device has you covered whether you’re after a polished curl, a beachy wave, or a subtle bend from the waver. And, it comes in a cute travel case for easy storage.</p><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Three tools in one; one-hour safety shut off; two-year warranty; good for a variety of skill levels thanks to the inclusion of a wand attachment</p><p><strong>What We Don’t:</strong> There’s no prop stand on this so it can burn your counter if you don’t put something like a towel down at your work station</p><p><strong>Material: </strong>Ceramic</p><p><strong>Temperature Range:</strong> Up to 450</p><p><strong>Barrel Size: </strong>1 inch wand; 1.5 inch curling rod; 0.75 inch waver</p><p><strong>Who It’s Good For: </strong>This tool works on all hair types and textures. It’s particularly good for thick hair that requires more heat to hold onto a curl. You’ll also have success with this regardless of skill level.</p><p><strong>Our Review: </strong>“I haven't strayed away from using my flat iron to curl my hair for years. And I don't love having to have multiple hair tools. The Mixologist changes the game for me. I like having multiple attachments that stay in a compact carrying case. It was also great to have options on ways I can curl/wave my hair. It's easy to use and a seamless process to take the wands on and off.” — <a href=# data-url=https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonelleafurong/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Jonelle Arfuong, Junior Visual Designer</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VYQKPnJRUEJ7PpgFmGiUfb-1920-80.png> <a href=# data-model-name="Pattern Beauty The 3-In-1 Interchangeable Curling Iron" data-url=https://www.ulta.com/p/3-in-1-interchangeable-curling-iron-pimprod2044765? referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url="https://shop-links.co/link?publisher_slug=future&exclusive=1&u1=hawk-custom-tracking&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2F3-in-1-interchangeable-curling-iron-pimprod2044765%3F&article_name=hawk-article-name&article_url=hawk-article-url" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name=ulta.com data-merchant-id=204095 data-merchant-url=ulta.com data-merchant-network=Generic readability=1><p class=vanilla-image-block data-bordeaux-image-check><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JtECZPGGeXSpYYMNBCmweS-1920-80.png><span class="featured__label horizontal__label">Best Curling Iron for Curly Hair</span></p></a><p>Pattern Beauty The 3-In-1 Interchangeable Curling Iron</p><p>The brainchild of Trace Ellis Ross, <a href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/pattern-beauty-curling-iron-launch/>Pattern’s 3-in-1 Interchangeable Curling Iron</a> is designed to enhance and add more structure to natural curls.

It might look a little funky at first, but the positioning actually takes all the guesswork out of curling. You’ll be left with traditional waves that weave together once brushed out. It’s also extremely comfortable to hold, making it a great option for anyone with upper back pain.</p><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Comfortable to hold and easy to use; versatile temperature settings; two hour auto shut off; you can preset how long you want to hold the tool to each piece of hair, so you’re left with uniform curls</p><p><strong>What We Don’t: </strong>The temperature goes up to 450, which is too high for anyone; it’s a bit cumbersome to store</p><p><strong>Material: </strong>24K gold, which is known to fast, even heat and long lasting results</p><p><strong>Temperature Range: </strong>Up to 450</p><p><strong>Barrel Size: </strong>1-inch</p><p><strong>Who It’s Good For: </strong>This curling iron is great for two cohorts of people: Those who can’t maneuver a traditional curling iron and those with thick, coarse hair. While it works for all hair types, the fact that it does reach higher temperatures means that it will be able to style—and hold—coarser hair.</p><p><strong>Our Review: </strong>“I’ll be honest, I wasn’t sure how to feel about the shape of this rod. But the second I turned it on, it was hard to deny the ease it provided. I achieved a uniform, old Hollywood style curl with ever single piece of hair. I decided to leave the ends out and brush through the curls before they totally cooled to get a beachier vibe. My best piece of advice is to really hold the bar as close to your scalp as possible if you want to boost volume. The photo below is at the end of the day, so these curls did last me over eight hours.” — Samantha Holender, Beauty Editor</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SBrQjxrY6Yed5umTFUKG7a-1920-80.png> <a href=# data-model-name="GHD Soft Curl 1.25-Inch Curling Iron " data-url="https://www.sephora.com/product/curve-1-25-soft-curl-iron-P389524?country_switch=us&lang=en&skuId=2126290&om_mmc=ppc-GG_18529129158_145040101111_pla-1963373331101_2126290_626692864002_9060351_c&gclid=Cj0KCQjw_r6hBhDdARIsAMIDhV_cbWx5bM7FbYb8gLhcCWXo266Tw5u638EOQY076VIDuB33EEr2DbUaAhBDEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url="https://shop-links.co/link?country_switch=us&lang=en&skuId=2126290&om_mmc=ppc-GG_18529129158_145040101111_pla-1963373331101_2126290_626692864002_9060351_c&gclid=Cj0KCQjw_r6hBhDdARIsAMIDhV_cbWx5bM7FbYb8gLhcCWXo266Tw5u638EOQY076VIDuB33EEr2DbUaAhBDEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds&publisher_slug=future&exclusive=1&u1=hawk-custom-tracking&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fcurve-1-25-soft-curl-iron-P389524%3Fcountry_switch%3Dus%26lang%3Den%26skuId%3D2126290%26om_mmc%3Dppc-GG_18529129158_145040101111_pla-1963373331101_2126290_626692864002_9060351_c%26gclid%3DCj0KCQjw_r6hBhDdARIsAMIDhV_cbWx5bM7FbYb8gLhcCWXo266Tw5u638EOQY076VIDuB33EEr2DbUaAhBDEALw_wcB%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds&article_name=hawk-article-name&article_url=hawk-article-url" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name=sephora.com data-merchant-id=204077 data-merchant-url=sephora.com data-merchant-network=Generic readability=1><p class=vanilla-image-block data-bordeaux-image-check><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mhXcqXX4harv6JbgasuPzf-1920-80.png><span class="featured__label horizontal__label">The Best Curling Iron for Shine</span></p></a><p>GHD Soft Curl 1.25-Inch Curling Iron</p><p>If you’re chasing a shiny finish, GHD is the way to go. This particular curling iron uses something called ultra-zone technology, which essentially means that the iron monitors its heat output 250 times per second (!!) to ensure the temperature is even and optimized across every strand of hair. The result? Smooth, silky hair that has an added reflective quality. It’s auto-set to 365 degrees and should be held on your hair for five to eight seconds, depending on your hair type.</p><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It adds amazing shine; heats up very quickly; reviewers say this holds their curls better than anything else on the market; shuts off automatically in 30 minutes; has a safety stand for when the tool isn’t being used</p><p><strong>What We Don’t: </strong>While 365 is a great temperature preset, this tool does not allow you to customize the temperature</p><p><strong>Material: </strong>Ceramic</p><p><strong>Temperature Range:</strong> 365</p><p><strong>Barrel Size: </strong>1.25-inch</p><p><strong>Who It’s Good For:</strong> Regardless of your hair texture or thickness, this is a curling iron worth considering. The chunkier barrel might not be as ideal for shorter hair types. It’s also worth noting that people who struggle to hold a curl seem to have success with this curling iron.</p><p><strong>Our Review: </strong>“A curling iron is a curling iron, right? WRONG! This curling iron is something altogether special. Heating up in literal seconds (it gives a nice little chime when it’s ready to rock), GHD’s Soft Curl was engineered to give your locks those lovely, luxe, and most of all soft (!) curls you’ve been dreaming of since your elementary school dance recital, when you watched the mom that really knew her way around a hot tool with awe. I’m as low maintenance as they come with my own hair, but something about throwing in a few ringlets with this tool doesn’t turn me off in the slightest. Maybe it’s the smooth hand feel? How quick it is? Honestly, I think it’s just ease altogether—and the fact that my locks look stellar.” — <a href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/author/sophia-vilensky/>Sophia Vilensky, Beauty Freelancer</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hR7QZjebHPB924L8A2DG5M-1920-80.png> <a href=# data-model-name="Ion Luxe Dual Voltage Cordless 1" ceramic curling wand data-url=https://www.amazon.com/Ion-Cordless-Friendly-Tourmaline-Technology/dp/B0C3S7YFMK referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=141596&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2FIon-Cordless-Friendly-Tourmaline-Technology%2Fdp%2FB0C3S7YFMK%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dhawk-custom-tracking-20" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name="Amazon US" data-merchant-id=1471 data-merchant-url=amazon.com data-merchant-network=Amazon readability=1><p class=vanilla-image-block data-bordeaux-image-check><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9yAw5DtU96CgiW5wEzvoAG-1920-80.jpg><span class="featured__label horizontal__label">Best Curling Iron Without a Clamp</span></p></a><p>Ion Luxe Dual Voltage Cordless 1" Ceramic Curling Wand</p><p>While high quality curling irons are typically a bit pricier, under $100 options do exist. One of the best is this IonLuxe option, which is very conveniently sold on Amazon. It’s clamp-less and cordless, which means it’s ideal for curling iron beginners. You don’t have to worry about creasing or how to maneuver a clamp—just wrap a chunk of hair around the barrel, hold it for roughly 10 seconds, and release. Just a note: You will have to charge this for two and half hours to get 35 minutes of cordless use.</p><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The cordless design makes this great for travel or on-the-go touch ups; it has three heat settings</p><p><strong>What We Don’t: </strong>While 365 is a great temperature preset, this tool does not allow you to customize the temperature; there’s no resting bar, so it will burn your counter if you dont put down a towel or heat pad</p><p><strong>Material: </strong>Ceramic and Tourmaline</p><p><strong>Temperature Range: </strong>340 to 410</p><p><strong>Barrel Size: </strong>1-inch</p><p><strong>Who It’s Good For:</strong> Ideal for beginners, this is incredibly easy to use thanks to the wand-style construction. Since the bar is boosted with tourmaline, which emits negative ions, this is also a great option for curly hair. It will lock in moisture and boost shine as it works.</p><p><strong>Our Review: </strong>“I’m hopeless with traditional curling irons—no matter how much I try, I get tangled in the cord and I can never get the technique right with the clamp. This curling wand, however, fixes all of my styling shortcomings. I love how I can go play around with my hand movements with its cordless design. Each charge lasts for 30 minutes, which is just what I need to curl my whole head. It’s also incredibly travel friendly thanks to its heatproof case. I only wish that the barrel was a tad bit bigger for my long hair. However, I’m still able to achieve long-lasting waves by wrapping my hair tighter around the barrel and heating it for just a few seconds.” — <a href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/author/brooke-knappenberger/>Brooke Knappenberger, Associate E-Commerce Editor</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JtECZPGGeXSpYYMNBCmweS-1920-80.png> <a href=# data-model-name="Shark FlexStyle Air Styling & Drying System and Multi-Styler for Straight & Wavy Hair" data-url=https://www.nordstrom.com/s/flexstyle-air-styling-drying-system-and-multi-styler-for-straight-wavy-hair/7591577? referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url="https://nordstrom.sjv.io/c/75786/1960196/23920?subId1=hawk-custom-tracking&sharedId=hawk-prefix&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2Fflexstyle-air-styling-drying-system-and-multi-styler-for-straight-wavy-hair%2F7591577%3F" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name=nordstrom.com data-merchant-id=480139 data-merchant-url=nordstrom.com data-merchant-network=ImpactRad readability=1><p class=vanilla-image-block data-bordeaux-image-check><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AhiHfZRpBcmrYZ9o8tyuAX-1920-80.jpg><span class="featured__label horizontal__label">Best Curling Iron for Hair Health</span></p></a><p>Shark FlexStyle Air Styling & Drying System and Multi-Styler for Straight & Wavy Hair</p><p>When this first came out in 2022, it was dubbed the Dyson dupe.

At a more reasonable price point and with a lightweight feel, the five-attachment tool is an effective multi-styler. As this is a curling iron roundup, we're here to discuss the two Auto Wrap attachments. Both have 1.25-inch barrel size, however they direct airflow in different directions.

It’s ideal for someone who is trying to preserve the health of their hair, as the temperature stays much lower than traditional curling irons and won’t lead to heat damage. That in mind, if your hair struggles to hold a curl, you most likely won’t have huge success here.</p><p><strong>Our Review: </strong>"I'm notoriously a heat tool critic, especially when it comes to curling irons. I have relatively thin hair, so the idea of heat damage haunts me. However, every once in a while, I like employing a curling iron to create a more consistent curl pattern all over my head. This curling iron is perfect for that, with two curling attachments that allow me to create both loose curls and tight coils. The temperature control is intuitive, the barrels heat quickly (great for when I'm in a rush), and because I only need one pass to create the curls I want, I don't feel like I'm incurring too much heat damage. Plus, I love that it has blow dryer attachments, including a diffuser made especially for curls. This is a versatile, all-in-one tool that I can see myself using again and again." — <a href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/author/gabrielle-ulubay/>Gabrielle Ulubay, Beauty Writer</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vzNE8WzhQSyWX3J293Qg6E-1920-80.jpg> <a href=# data-model-name="Wavytalk Thermal Brush, Negative Ion Thermal Brush With Ceramic Tourmaline" data-url="https://www.amazon.com/Wavytalk-Thermal-Negative-Ceramic-Tourmaline/dp/B0CQSNTPC6/ref=asc_df_B0CQSNTPC6/?" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=141596&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2FWavytalk-Thermal-Negative-Ceramic-Tourmaline%2Fdp%2FB0CQSNTPC6%2Fref%3Dasc_df_B0CQSNTPC6%2F%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dhawk-custom-tracking-20" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name="Amazon US" data-merchant-id=1471 data-merchant-url=amazon.com data-merchant-network=Amazon readability=1><p class=vanilla-image-block data-bordeaux-image-check><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aqdngSNWyB3mzaCx4f5ep4-1920-80.jpg><span class="featured__label horizontal__label">The Best Heated Brush Curling Iron</span></p></a><p>Wavytalk Thermal Brush, Negative Ion Thermal Brush With Ceramic Tourmaline</p><p>Standard curling irons are amazing.

It's made with a titanium, extra-long rod to evenly distribute heat through the length and density of the hair, while simultaneously knocking out majority of frizz. The duration of time you need to keep each strand clamped will differ person to person, but it will probably be a bit longer than normal.

That in mind, this ridiculously lightweight design is game-changing. The slim curling iron feels like a feather (well, not really but you get the point) in your hand and the spring clamp makes it super easy to maneuver. Plus, it has a compact size that can be great for travel—or adding curls to bobs, lobs, or other short hairstyles.</p><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> Great for travel; lightweight feel; works for short hair; gets very hot</p><p><strong>What We Don’t: </strong>While it can be great to travel with, it is challenging to twirl down a long strand of hair due to size</p><p><strong>Material: </strong>Titanium</p><p><strong>Temperature Range: </strong>320 to 395</p><p><strong>Barrel Size: </strong>1-inch</p><p><strong>Who It’s Good For:</strong> It’s great for those with shorter hairstyles or anyone who finds a longer barrel difficult to use. This is also a titanium design, so it’s ideal for people who struggle to get long-lasting results.</p><h3 class=article-body__section id=section-how-do-you-curl-hair><span>How Do You Curl Hair?</span></h3><p>The size of your barrel and the temperature obviously play a role in your final curl, but technique is an important part of the equation. How you twist your hair, how long you hold it, and your positioning all impact the final outcome.</p><p>When using a curling iron with a clamp, there are two primary techniques. "One method is to place the ends of your hair into the clamp and then wrap the hair around the barrel by spinning the curling iron, usually with the iron placed upwards and the clamp facing the mirror. This method typically results in looser curls," explains Cavalcante. "The other method is to hold the clamp open downward, wrap the entire hair strand around the barrel like a ribbon around a pole, and then close the clamp. This technique creates more structured curls.</p><p>How you wrap the hair around the barrel will also factor into the shape of your curl. “If you tighten the hair from the top to the bottom, you’ll get a super springy curl, but if you just loosely wrap you’ll get more of a blown-out look,” explains Josh.</p><h3 class=article-body__section id=section-how-to-make-curls-last><span>How to Make Curls Last</span></h3><p>It's a tale as old as time. You curl your hair and looks great—only for it to completely fall a few hours later. Thankfully, a few easy styling tips will help you secure the shape so your curls can last all day.</p><p>"Allow curls to cool completely before touching them, which helps set the curl. For special occasions like weddings, you can wrap each curl around your finger and secure it with a clip immediately after curling, letting it rest and cool for 10 to 30 minutes," notes Cavalcante. You many also want to use a light-hold hairspray or setting spray after curling each section and avoid over-brushing to maintain curl definition.</p><h3 class=article-body__section id=section-how-do-you-clean-a-curling-iron><span>How Do You Clean a Curling Iron?</span></h3><p>It's highly possible you never once thought about cleaning your curling iron. But take it from Cavalcante: it's a very important step. "Curling irons should be cleaned from time to time to remove product buildup, especially if you use oils and hairspray on your hair before styling," he explains. All you have to do is wipe the barrel with a damp cloth every few weeks, depending on the frequency you use your curling iron. Just ensure the tool is off and completely cool before doing so.</p><h3 class=article-body__section id=section-meet-the-experts><span>Meet the Experts</span></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sbjdDsGXXrnhoBDcd9RLe4-1920-80.png><span class=person__name>Clariss Rubenstein</span><a class=button-social href=# aria-label=INSTAGRAM><span class=button-social__icon></span></a><a class=button-social href=# aria-label=WEBSITE><span class="button-social__icon button-social__icon-website"></span></a>Celebrity Hair Stylist<p>Clariss Rubenstein is a Los Angeles based hairstylist.
