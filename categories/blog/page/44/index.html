I am thinking of you
In my sleepless solitude tonight
If it's wrong to love you
Then my heart just won't let me be right
'Cause I'm drowned in you
And I won't pull through
Without you by my sideChorus

Just one more night with you
I'd risk my life to feel
Your body next to mine
'Cause I can't go on
