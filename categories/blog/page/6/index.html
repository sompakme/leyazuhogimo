Cam Gigandet shot to fame playing the guy everyone loved to hate both in the&nbsp;Twilight&nbsp;series, and teen hit,&nbsp;The O.C.&nbsp;Hanging up his villainous cape in 2014, the actor then starred in short-lived CBS legal drama&nbsp;Reckless, playing a divorced father-of-two attorney. Although we're used to seeing the blonde actor scowl on camera, he revealed in an interview with&nbsp;Collider&nbsp;that he likes "having that balance" between playing both bad guys and good. After&nbsp;Reckless&nbsp;got canceled, Gigandet took on a role in the AT&T Original Series&nbsp;Ice, which lasted from 2016 to 2018 and was met to, unfortunately,&nbsp;lackluster reviews.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Who is the daughter of Thor?</h2><time>Sep 29, 2024</time>

Answer
Re: Gee, your hair smells fantastic! The shampoo and conditioner are fantastic!
The original recipe used deer musk oil, which is now prohibited by the International Fragrance Association, therefore it will never smell the same if it is created using synthetic musk oil instead of the original. Because of this, a large number of your favourite fragrances no longer smell the way they used to.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Chelsea Handler frees her nipples on a snowy mountaintop (PHOTOS)</h2><time>Sep 28, 2024</time>
