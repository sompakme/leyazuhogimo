<a href=../../../../captain-marvel-new-images-reveal-young-nick-fury-skrulls-villain.html></a>
We got our first look at Brie Larson’s Captain Marvel earlier today, and now new images from the movie are rolling out from Entertainment Weekly, giving glimpses of the other actors and characters that featured in the next installment of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
Notably, Samuel L. Jackson’s Nick Fury has been digitally de-aged to look 25 years younger (the movie takes place in the ’90s, hence a younger, eyepatch-less Fury).</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Don Toliver Shares New Snippet, &amp;quot;VULTURES 2&amp;quot; Listening Event Adds More</h2><time>Aug 24, 2024</time>

Don Toliver just dropped "Bandit" last month, and with a new previewed track, it seems like he's got a lot more coming. Moreover, new snippets emerged from his social media accounts that are circulating online over his next song "Deep In The Water," which will reportedly come out next Friday (March 15) and features his boo Kali Uchis amid some pretty visuals. Sonically, the teased portions are pretty moody and deeply trap and sultry R&B-inspired, as expected from the Cactus Jack artist.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Future Accused Of Texting Son That His Mother Brittni Is A &amp;quot;Hoe&amp;quot;</h2><time>Aug 24, 2024</time>

Rappers and the mothers of their children don't always get along, and often, they take their grievances to social media. It seems as if Future has beenembroiled in drama involving one or more of themothers of children for years, from Ciarato Eliza Reign to Brittni Mealy, and the latter shared screenshots of an alleged exchange between the rapper and their son, Prince Wilburn, that raised eyebrows.
Brittni popped up on her Instagram Story with the messages and she was so upset that she didn't even censor her ex's phone number.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Gianfranco Zola Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</h2><time>Aug 24, 2024</time>

by Amanda London · Published June 1, 2023 · Updated June 1, 2023 Sam Barber, though having a notable social-media presence, is sort of an enigma as of this writing.&nbsp;For instance, background information on this song is woefully scant.
