The adaptation follows a new clique whose world is rocked by an accidental murder at a bachelorette party. The incident sets in motion an audacious, juicy soap in which the women will go to great lengths to keep their secret hidden.</p><p>Feature film writer-director Darren Stein is on board to pen the script for the drama. The project hails from Sony Pictures Television, whose film sibling <span data-scayt_word=Tristar data-scaytid=3>Tristar</span> Pictures distributed the original. (Should Jawbreaker move to series, <span data-scayt_word="NBCU's" data-scaytid=4>NBCU’s</span> Universal Cable Productions would board the show as a co-producer.)</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p>Jawbreaker starred Rose McGowan, Julie Benz, Rebecca <span data-scayt_word=Gayheart data-scaytid=5>Gayheart</span> and Charlotte <span data-scayt_word=Ayanna data-scaytid=6>Ayanna</span> as a clique called the “Flawless Four,” the most popular girls at Reagan High in Los Angeles. <span data-scayt_word="Ayanna's" data-scaytid=7>Ayanna’s</span> Liz is surprised on the morning of her <span data-scayt_word=17th data-scaytid=8>17th</span> birthday by her friends, who shove a jawbreaker into her mouth and kidnap her as part of a prank to take her to breakfast. Only she dies in the process, creating the drama that ensues. Judy Greer, Carol Kane and Pam <span data-scayt_word=Grier data-scaytid=9>Grier</span> co-starred in the original, which grossed $3.1 million on a budget of $3.5 million. The film, which was considered one of the worst to debut in 1999, went on to gain a cult following for its Mean Girls- and Heathers-like comedy.</p><p>Stein and George <span data-scayt_word=Northy data-scaytid=10>Northy</span> (MTV’s Faking It) will pen the script together and executive produce. Jawbreaker reunites Stein with G.B.F. writer <span data-scayt_word=Northy data-scaytid=11>Northy</span>. Stein is <span data-scayt_word=repped data-scaytid=14>repped</span> by APA and Untitled.</p><p>Jawbreaker arrives as E! is looking to expand its scripted roster beyond The Royals, its first scripted series, and the forthcoming <a href=#>The Arrangement</a>, the latter of <span data-scayt_word=whic data-scaytid=212>whic</span> is set to bow March 5.</p><p>Reboots continue to remain in high demand as broadcast, cable and streaming outlets look for proven IP in a bid to cut through a cluttered scripted landscape that is quickly approaching 500 original series. Key to the remakes is having the original producers involved in some capacity — which Jawbreaker has with Sony TV and Stein — as more studios look to monetize their existing film and TV libraries.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue9OvZq2uXaOyuL%2BOo5iwmqKarqyx0Warr2Wjmr%2BqsdJmrqiqm6h6osCMnmRyb2Zqf3R7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./glynn-turman-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Glynn Turman Net Worth</span></a>
