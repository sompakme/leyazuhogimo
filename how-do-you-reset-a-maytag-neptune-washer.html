If the code is still on the screen, unplug the washer or turn off the power for one minute to clear it. During the Clean Washer cycle, it was discovered that there were items in the washer. Items should be removed from the drum before starting the Clean Washer cycle a second time.</p><p></p><h3>What may be the source of a Maytag washer’s inability to spin?</h3><p>A typical reason why a Maytag top load washer won’t spin is due to an imbalanced load or clothes that has been stuck in the machine. During a washing cycle, larger objects or loads have a tendency to settle on one side of the drum. Try redistributing the load or removing a few pieces of clothes from the load before running the spin cycle on your washer once again.</p><p></p><h3>What is the best way to reset my washing machine?</h3><p>How to re-start the washing machine: To switch off the washer, press the POWER button. Alternatively, unplug the washer from its power outlet or switch off the circuit breaker that serves the machine. While the power is turned off, press and hold the START/PAUSE button for 5 seconds to begin the process. Reconnect the washer’s hoses or reset the circuit breaker if necessary.</p><p></p><h3>How do you re-set a front-loading washing machine?</h3><p>How to re-start the washing machine: To switch off the washer, press the POWER button. Alternatively, unplug the washer from its power outlet or switch off the circuit breaker that serves the machine. While the power is turned off, press and hold the START/PAUSE button for 5 seconds to begin the process. Reconnect the washer’s hoses or reset the circuit breaker if necessary.</p><p></p><h3>In the event of a power outage, how can I reset my Maytag washer?</h3><p>Remove the plug or switch off the circuit breaker for 30 seconds. Connect the power cable to a wall outlet or reset the circuit breaker and wait 30 seconds before continuing. To clear the display, press the Pause / Cancel / Stop button twice in quick succession.</p><p></p><h3>A manual unlocking procedure for a Maytag front-loading washer is described below.</h3><p>Locate the bottom of the door switch/lock mechanism by reaching up along the inside of the front and up along the inside of the back. A tear-shaped tab may be found on the bottom of the door switch/lock mechanism, towards the bottom of the door. Gently pull the tab down approximately 1/4 inch, or until you hear a click, until the tab is released. It is now possible to open the door.</p><p></p><h3>What is causing my Maytag washer to stop working?</h3><p>Some typical Maytag front-load washer issues include the washer not agitating or spinning, as well as the washer not emptying or filling with water. It’s possible that your washing machine vibrates during spin cycles or makes sounds while running through the wash cycle. Let’s face it, Maytag is a terrific brand, but if the washer isn’t operating, that’s not a good situation for anybody.</p><p></p><h3>What is the best way to identify a dryer problem?</h3><p>Problem: The dryer will not turn on. It’s possible that the door latch isn’t working properly. Check for lint in the latch and thoroughly clean it to ensure that the door shuts correctly when closed. Make sure that the power supply is working properly, including the fuses and circuit breakers. Check the thermal fuse on the inside of the dryer. If you have a push start knob, it is possible that it is not engaging properly.</p><h3></h3><h3>Do Maytag Neptune models have codes?</h3><p>Error codes on a washing machine might indicate little or major problems with the equipment. The DO code, for example, indicates that the door is open or that the door lock has failed to engage when the door is opened. To resolve the DO error code, open the door and close it again many times.</p><p></p><h3>What does the letter Fl stand for on a Maytag Neptune washing machine?</h3><p>The “FL” indicates that the door has failed to lock, or that the door has locked but the control has not detected that the door has been closed. It might be caused by a defective door lock solenoid, among other things.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r6%2FEq6upp5mjwW%2BvzqZma2hiZ3xxfY6hprBllKR6urvUZqmeq5WpeqJ5zJqwrZmXYrumvNOupZ5lp5bAqbHRZ5%2BtpZw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./has-non-alcoholic-wine-finally-got-good.html><span>←</span><span>Has non-alcoholic wine finally got good?</span></a>
