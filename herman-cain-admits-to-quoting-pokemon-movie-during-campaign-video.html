I’m not sure who the original author is, so don’t go write an article about the poet, but it says a lot about where I am — where I am with my wife and my family, and where we are as a nation,” Cain said, according to the <a href=# rel=nofollow>Huffington Post.</a> “Life can be a challenge. Life can seem impossible. It’s never easy when there’s so much on the line. But you and I can make a difference. There’s a mission just for you and me.”</p><p>Cain also admittted to <a href=# rel=nofollow>GQ</a> in a recent interview that he first heard the song during the Olympics and instantly sparked to it.</p><p><strong><a href=#>PHOTOS: Actors Who’ve Played Politicians</a></strong></p><p>“I fell in love with this song, fell in love with how she sang the song and fell in love with the words,” she said. “Committed it to memory. Now, why did I commit it to memory? Because one of the things that I did before I ran for president is I was a professional speaker. Not a motivational speaker — an inspirational speaker. Motivation comes from within. You have to be inspired. That’s what I do. I inspire people, I inspire the public, I inspire my staff. I inspired the organizations I took over to want to succeed.”</p><p>Watch the video of Cain making the quote, with the song playing in the background, below.</p><p></p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8yoraKdo2S6sMLInmSnnaeofKmx0aaYp2WTlravecaop2aooprAqrDEp6uimZxisKK6w6KbmqyVYr2wt8SmpqdlYmuGdYOQaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./fox-news-laura-ingraham-drops-radio-show-for-podcast.html><span>←</span><span>Fox News' Laura Ingraham Drops Radio Show for Podcast</span></a>
