We know that he traveled with the family to California in 1864, being only 13. He would have been 17 when the Earps moved yet again, this time to Lamar, Missouri, per <a href=#>HistoryNet</a>. Some sources record Morgan, who reportedly looked much like his older brothers Virgil and Wyatt, getting into a "street fight" with the Sutherlands, whose daughter Urilla was Wyatt's first wife.</p><p dir=ltr>Morgan accompanied Wyatt buffalo hunting, went gold prospecting on his own, and, like so many of the Earps, made his way into law enforcement in the mid-1870s. Beyond the bare outlines of the story, however, the details of Morgan's life — such as exactly when and where he acted as a police officer — remain sketchy. It is clear, however, per the Sun, that Morgan was one of the participants in the October 1881 gunfight at the O.K. Corral, where he was wounded.</p><p>Morgan Earp may be best known for his sudden and violent death at the age of 30. As per HistoryNet, he was playing pool at a saloon in Tombstone on the evening of March 18, 1882. Suddenly, two bullets were fired by an unknown assailant, though it was almost certainly someone who wanted revenge for the deaths at the O.K. Corral. Morgan, who, according to Wyatt Earp biographer Stuart N. Lake ("<a href=#>Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshal</a>," via HistoryNet) had spoken with Wyatt about "visions of heaven" experienced by the dying, reportedly told his older brother: "I can't see a damn thing" before he died himself.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCFl2ptcm9frMaiwNNmnJqqoKh6p63MoqOyZaSnsqZ5xLGnpZmZo7Klew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./well-spent-life-allwell-ademola-shares-history-of-her-grandpa-who-was-chief-justice-of-nigeri.html><span>←</span><span>Well Spent Life: Allwell Ademola Shares History of Her Grandpa Who Was Chief Justice of Nigeri</span></a>
