The Stranger Things actress <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>appeared on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon </a>on February 29 to talk about how her fiancé popped the question, revealing the proposal took place underwater à la The Little Mermaid.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The memorable moment took place while Brown and Bongiovi were on vacation. Initially, the actress didn't want to get up so early for their day's activities. “Mil, you got to be up at 8:00 a.m., we’re going on a dive,'” she recalled her fiancé saying on the big day.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I was like, ‘8 a.m., dive?’ ... And he’s telling me, ‘We’re going to the same spot we usually go to,’” she continued. “I’m like, ‘It’s boring, let’s go somewhere new.’ He’s like, ‘No, we have to go to this spot.’”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After diving to their special place, Bongiovi — who is the son of rock singer Jon Bon Jovi and his wife, Dorothea Hurley — presented her with the ring in an incredibly special way.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“He gives me a shell, and I turn it over, and it’s a ring," she recalled. Because of the circumstances, Brown couldn't say yes to marrying him in a traditional manner. She couldn't give him a thumbs up for "yes" — "That would technically mean, ‘No, I don’t want to marry you, I want to go up [to the surface]’” — she made an "OK" sign with her fingers to say yes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After putting on the ring, still underwater, another cinematic moment happened: "The ring falls off my finger, plummets like, so fast, it was like a cinematic movie. Jake threw himself, like so deep, like the diver was like, ‘You can’t do that, like your ears ... literally your brain will explode.’” Thankfully, Bongiovi made it back just fine, and the ring was saved.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The sweetness of the story didn't stop there — the Enola Holmes actress also revealed that Bongiovi's underwater ring was a decoy for her mothers, who didn't want her ring getting dropped into the ocean before he had a chance to give it to her daughter.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“So when we got up on the boat, he was like, ‘This is your mom’s ring, and I got it from your parents,’ ” she explained. “And it was very magical, and his parents were there, and we just looked so disheveled coming out from a dive.”<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zKKjpaGVYq%2BwrsGyZJuqn6y7brbApJxmmp%2BjtKq71aJkqaqfpby0rctmqq2noq56eYKPbGdtbg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./megan-fox-finally-covers-up-massive-brian-austin-green-tattoo.html><span>←</span><span>Megan Fox Finally Covers Up Massive Brian Austin Green Tattoo</span></a>
