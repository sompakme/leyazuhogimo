According to <a href=#>Billboard</a>, Lovato teased a new song on her Instagram Story in August 2020 with the caption "#D7," as her seventh studio album title has yet to be released.&nbsp;</p><p>Outside of working on the elusive album, the pop star bought a mansion in September 2020. According to&nbsp;<a href=#>Variety</a>, the "Stone Cold" singer purchased a $7 million&nbsp;modern farmhouse-style home in the Studio City area. The 8,500-square-foot property comes with six bedrooms, nine bathrooms, and "all the amenities one would expect of a luxury residence in the San Fernando Valley,&nbsp;including top-of-the-line kitchen appliances, a wet bar-equipped lounge, an elevator, and a soundproof home theater."&nbsp;</p><p>With that kind of price tag, was the home a splurge or a drop in the bucket? Well, according to <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Lovato is worth $40 million, so the purchase was definitely leaning toward drop in the bucket status. Since she is single as of September 2020 following the <a href=#>news that&nbsp;she ended her engagement with Max Ehrich</a>, maybe the singer can cuddle with her multi-millions (we would).&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma21iZoBze8OepKJlnKTDosDOZp%2Bor12iwqS0jKKqZqyYmnq0tc2gnKtlp6S%2FtbSO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./he-s-so-cool-moment-rema-arrived-texas-show-on-a-bicycle-with-colourful-balloons-oyinbo.html><span>←</span><span>Hes So Cool: Moment Rema Arrived Texas Show on a Bicycle With Colourful Balloons, Oyinbo</span></a>
