Two teens are trapped in an infinite time loop, and they have to figure out why and how to get out of it. The wrinkle in&nbsp;this&nbsp;time-travel movie is that the girl (Newton) might not want to break the loop after all. Time travel love stories are always interesting, and this one looks like tween rom-com gold.</p><h2 id=apos-barb-and-star-go-to-vista-del-mar-apos-3>'Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar'</h2><p><a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.amazon.com/Barb-Star-Vista-Del-Mar/dp/B08VVJXF27 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=141596&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2FBarb-Star-Vista-Del-Mar%2Fdp%2FB08VVJXF27%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dhawk-custom-tracking-20" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name="Amazon US" data-merchant-id=1471 data-merchant-url=amazon.com data-merchant-network=Amazon>WATCH IT</a></p><p><strong>Release Date:&nbsp;</strong>February 12, 2021</p><p><strong>Starring:&nbsp;</strong>Kristen Wiig, Annie Mumolo, Jamie Dornan, Damon Wayans Jr., Reyn Doi, Vanessa Bayer</p><p>This film kind of shouldn't work—it's about two friends (Wiig and Mumolo) who take a vacation, while a supervillain (also Wiig) plans to destroy the town because they...made fun of her when she was a kid? Some film critics hate, hate, hated this film with a passion. But a lot more of them loved the cuteness, the banter, the fact that these two women live in their own world of pure joy. I'm in the second camp, and I recommend it to everybody.</p><h2 id=apos-willy-apos-s-wonderland-apos-3>'Willy's Wonderland'</h2><p><a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url="https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/amzn1.dv.gti.1cbba108-9a25-8943-61af-455b316674f0?autoplay=1&ref_=atv_cf_strg_wb" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=141596&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fgp%2Fvideo%2Fdetail%2Famzn1.dv.gti.1cbba108-9a25-8943-61af-455b316674f0%3Fautoplay%3D1%26ref_%3Datv_cf_strg_wb%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dhawk-custom-tracking-20" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name="Amazon US" data-merchant-id=1471 data-merchant-url=amazon.com data-merchant-network=Amazon>WATCH IT</a></p><p><strong>Release Date:&nbsp;</strong>February 12, 2021</p><p><strong>Starring:&nbsp;</strong>Nicolas Cage, Emily Tosta, Beth Grant, David Sheftell, Ric Reitz, Chris Warner, Kai Kadlec, Caylee Cowan</p><p>As goofy as it is nuts, Nicolas Cage is PERFECTLY cast. He's the nearly wordless hero(?) who's tasked with cleaning a "family fun center" a la Chuck E. Cheese in exchange for the owner fixing his car. Except instead of the animatronics jerkily lapsing into song, they try to murder you.

Stuck at home for what feels like an eternity (ugh), they hatch a plan to solve their financial problems...and maybe rediscover what they liked about each other in the first place.

Emily (Spencer) has invented a serum to give people superpowers, and her BFF Lydia (McCarthy) accidentally takes it. The two turn into an unlikely crime-fighting duo against The King (Cannavale, who had excellent banter with McCarthy in&nbsp;Spy).

A married couple have the perfect relationship, and their friends loaaathe them for it. A mysterious stranger suggests a "correction" of sorts—and, just like with&nbsp;The Shining, it goes super poorly.

This second attempt at a reboot, finally being released after a lot of COVID delays, is informed by a lot of nostalgia for the original.

The one based on a Twitter thread? You know! This one was supposed to come out in 2020 but we're finally getting it this summer: Zola (Paige) bonds with fellow pole dancer Stefani (Keough) and the two decide to take a road trip to Florida with Stefani's pimp and boyfriend.

The&nbsp;Spider-Man&nbsp;films benefit from this as well as a cheerfully earnest Holland delivering them.
