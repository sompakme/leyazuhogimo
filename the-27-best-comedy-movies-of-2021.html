Two teens are trapped in an infinite time loop, and they have to figure out why and how to get out of it. The wrinkle in&nbsp;this&nbsp;time-travel movie is that the girl (Newton) might not want to break the loop after all. Time travel love stories are always interesting, and this one looks like tween rom-com gold.</p><h2 id=apos-barb-and-star-go-to-vista-del-mar-apos-3>'Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar'</h2><p><a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.amazon.com/Barb-Star-Vista-Del-Mar/dp/B08VVJXF27 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=141596&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2FBarb-Star-Vista-Del-Mar%2Fdp%2FB08VVJXF27%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dhawk-custom-tracking-20" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name="Amazon US" data-merchant-id=1471 data-merchant-url=amazon.com data-merchant-network=Amazon>WATCH IT</a></p><p><strong>Release Date:&nbsp;</strong>February 12, 2021</p><p><strong>Starring:&nbsp;</strong>Kristen Wiig, Annie Mumolo, Jamie Dornan, Damon Wayans Jr., Reyn Doi, Vanessa Bayer</p><p>This film kind of shouldn't work‚Äîit's about two friends (Wiig and Mumolo) who take a vacation, while a supervillain (also Wiig) plans to destroy the town because they...made fun of her when she was a kid? Some film critics hate, hate, hated this film with a passion. But a lot more of them loved the cuteness, the banter, the fact that these two women live in their own world of pure joy.

He's the nearly wordless hero(?) who's tasked with cleaning a "family fun center" a la Chuck E. Cheese in exchange for the owner fixing his car. Except instead of the animatronics jerkily lapsing into song, they try to murder you.

Stuck at home for what feels like an eternity (ugh), they hatch a plan to solve their financial problems...and maybe rediscover what they liked about each other in the first place.

There's basically no in-between with this: You either love-to-hate Pike as her character defrauds senior citizens, or you just hate her. This is the definition of black comedy, and it's not for everyone, but Pike post-Gone Girl&nbsp;plays merrily abhorrent to perfection.</p><h2 id=apos-french-exit-apos-3>'French Exit'</h2><p><a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url="https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/amzn1.dv.gti.8ebc1c7d-a74b-9ef1-6ed6-a8bd5108e71b?autoplay=1&ref_=atv_cf_strg_wb" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=141596&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fgp%2Fvideo%2Fdetail%2Famzn1.dv.gti.8ebc1c7d-a74b-9ef1-6ed6-a8bd5108e71b%3Fautoplay%3D1%26ref_%3Datv_cf_strg_wb%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dhawk-custom-tracking-20" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name="Amazon US" data-merchant-id=1471 data-merchant-url=amazon.com data-merchant-network=Amazon>WATCH IT</a></p><p><strong>Release Date:&nbsp;</strong>February 12, 2021</p><p><strong>Starring:&nbsp;</strong>Michelle Pfeiffer, Lucas Hedges, Danielle Macdonald, Imogen Poots, Tracy Letts, Valerie Mahaffey</p><p>Patrick deWitt's razor-sharp book has been compared to a kind of "<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.popmatters.com/french-exit-azazel-jacobs referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>trans-atlantic&nbsp;Arrested Development.</a>" At the center is Frances‚ÄîPfeiffer has never been better, apparently‚Äîwhose spendthrift days as a socialite are behind her.

Emily (Spencer) has invented a serum to give people superpowers, and her BFF Lydia (McCarthy) accidentally takes it. The two turn into an unlikely crime-fighting duo against The King (Cannavale, who had excellent banter with McCarthy in&nbsp;Spy).

A married couple have the perfect relationship, and their friends loaaathe them for it.
