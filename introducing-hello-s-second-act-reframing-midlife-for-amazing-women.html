We're more confident in ourselves and free from society's expectations. "In midlife, you realise that life is too short, and you do a declutter, fine-tuning certain aspects and making space for only good things," says beauty icon Ruby Hammer, 62.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2cad71f7ae78-smiling-ruby.jpg><p id=ek9QRU-oVVg data-wc=24>"Silly things suddenly don't bother you," Ruby adds.

Fashion doesn't stop at 45</strong></h3><p id=educy96m_rS data-wc=44>"As we get older, the phrase 'dressing for your age' is thrown around a lot, but at 54, I am absolutely not 'dressing for my age'," says <a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>stylist Lisa Talbot</a>. "I'm dressing for the person I am, and the woman I want to be.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/4def084b8a88-lisatalbot-42-sizereduced.jpg><p id=e6Nw4cfdlcv data-wc=62>"There's a notion in society that when we hit 45, become a mother, or start a new job role, we should flick a style switch and suddenly be dressing as a different person just because of our age or situation. But I believe it's more important to dress according to the person that we are, rather than for how old we are.</p><p id=ecV9NstXorSp data-wc=32>"For the ultimate confidence boost, forget how you 'should' dress, and instead embrace who you are and wear the clothes that you love and give you confidence - no matter your age!"</p><p id=e7sPzDQl9yb data-wc=13><strong>MORE FROM LISA: <a class=hm-link href=#>Why I'm absolutely not 'dressing for my age' at 54</a></strong></p><h3><strong>2. It's not too late to get into fitness</strong></h3><p id=eC4hfMuFQjsh data-wc=64>"I teach a group of midlife women at the gym and many of them worry that they might not fit in at the gym," says Esme Stone, 51, of <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>JD Williams</a>, who teaches yoga and Pilates. "In their mind's eye, they imagine gyms full of nubile 20-something women in crop tops, but in reality, the gym is a place for every kind of body.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/dfe930079a0c-esme-stone-jd-williams-2.jpg><p id=eHlXhJPnIlWN data-wc=35>"I reassure my clients that nobody is looking at them because everyone is worrying about themselves. The real success of exercise is not caring about what other people think of you and just cracking on.</p><p id=m_3841512222128045870eHwJjxhd9Dl0 data-wc=40>"Remember that every single person in your class has been the new person at some point and they too felt daunted. Everyone will have empathy for you because they will remember what it was like to be in your position."</p><p id=eslpQ_7T58wc data-wc=10><strong>INSPIRATION:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>What midlife women want you to know about exercise&nbsp;</a></p><h3><strong>3. Your confidence comes flooding back</strong></h3><p id=egDkp9T5SxCi data-wc=33>Too often we're told confidence dwindles as we get older and we feel we're not who we used to be, but lots of the women we spoke to said they found the opposite.</p><p id=eqL3kNkatuYJ data-wc=36>"As we get older and learn about ourselves, we tend to become more confident advocating for what we want because we care less about what other people think of us," says Hannah Albertshauser, co-founder of <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopenernofollow nofollow">Bloom</a>.</p><p id=eJt11ZfMkRg data-wc=12><strong>READ: <a class=hm-link href=#>Why women in their 40s are more confident voicing their desires</a></strong></p><h3><strong>4 .You set yourself new, realistic benchmarks</strong></h3><p id=e_9X_B3xNzrD data-wc=21>Midlife gives us the ability to accept where we are now and not compare ourselves to former versions, says Ruby Hammer.</p><p id=ew08DD9W4WAa data-wc=45>"Rather than trying to be who you were at 21, 31, or 41, enjoy where you are now," Ruby advises. "Don't hold yourself to the same standards. Sure, maybe you can't run like you did in your thirties, but you still can run!" she celebrates.</p><p id=e6sFyIcPFg7D data-wc=11><strong>&nbsp;READ: <a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>Sadie Frost's second act: 'I'm the best version of me'</a></strong></p><h3><strong>5. You gain new perspective</strong></h3><p id=eSkJkOE9HsIu data-wc=35>In midlife, we come to appreciate ourselves more as we are now, and how we used to be. "Any time spent lamenting my body over the years was a waste of that body," Ruby says.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/08c19f35d1a4-nintchdbpict000673799214.jpg><p id=esABX0ODkUKI data-wc=55>This is a mindset model Mia Mauge, 54, agrees with, sharing: "When I was in my forties, I feared ageing. I look back and think, 'What a waste of precious time that was.' Midlife has been the most magical time of evolution for me, and I wished I'd know that it would be so powerful"</p><p id=eWdj1vrd-9uV data-wc=14><strong>&nbsp;MORE FROM MIA: <a class=hm-link href=#>I changed my entire life at 54 – here's what happened</a></strong></p><h3><strong>6. There's more time for friendship in midlife</strong></h3><p id=etRZ2ACUQkDG data-wc=42>"Since being in my fifties, I nurture and value my long-term friendships so much more, due to the time we have invested in each other and the many highs and lows we have experienced between us through the decades," says Anna Richards.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/947b04b80c01-anna-richardsheadshot1-170939.jpg><p id=m_3841512222128045870eL4X50brubA3 data-wc=37>"These are precious, meaningful friendships that are even more important to me in my 50s.
