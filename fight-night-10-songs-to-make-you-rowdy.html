Forget the sappy, slow inspirational songs. We’re talking about songs that get you amped, songs that get your blood flowing no matter what time of day. While we are not condoning violence in any way, we put together a list of the top ten songs you want to fight to. These songs will turn your energy level way up, whether it’s the beat or the inspirational message in the lyrics. From throwbacks to recent hits, this playlist will get your through that wall with flying colors.</p><br><h2><a href=# class=text-word>Migos</a>- Fight Night</h2><p>Fight Night: 10 Songs To Make You Rowdy</p><p>Obviously this had to be on here. If you are heated at the club, waiting for that perfect moment to strike, "Fight Night" just might be your cue. We are by no means&nbsp;promoting violence, we're just saying this track will get you hyped no matter where you might be. If you're looking to turn up, Migos never fails. Unfortunately, the lyrics got real for the Atlanta trio during a performance in Springfield, Massachusetts last month in October. Migos member Offset apparently jumped off stage into the crowd and punched a concert attendee.&nbsp;Warning: do not re-enact.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p><h2>Ludacris- Move Bitch</h2></p><p>Fight Night: 10 Songs To Make You Rowdy</p><p>Move, bitch. Get out the way. CLASSIC. And probably one of Luda's best tracks to this day. "Move Bitch" featuring <a href=# class=text-word rel>Mystikal</a> and I-20 was at one point a part of everyone's party playlist. You should definitely bring it back. This banger sets the mood for anybody who steps in your way. Luda's opening verse: "Oh no! The fight's out.&nbsp;I'm bout to punch your lights out.&nbsp;Get the fuck back, guard your grill..."</p><p></p><p><h2>Tupac- Hit 'Em Up.</h2></p><p>Fight Night: 10 Songs To Make You Rowdy</p><p>There's no way this song would not make it on this list. "Hit 'Em Up" by Tupac is one of the realest, thuggest songs you will find in hip hop. The track came out in the midst of the East Coast/West Coast rivalry, aka the Biggie versus Tupac fiasco. In the song, Tupac and the Outlawz have no filter, calling people out by name and issuing threats of violence. The anger and emotion enclosed in this track is proof of why Tupac is one of hip hop's greatest.</p><p></p><p><h2>Brooke Valentine- Girlfight</h2></p><p>Fight Night: 10 Songs To Make You Rowdy</p><p>There's about to be...a what! GIRLFIGHT.&nbsp;You know there had to be at least one track dedicated to the females. "Girlfight" by Brooke Valentine featuring Lil' Jon and <a href=# class=text-word rel>Big Boi</a> does just that. Of course, girl fights are a lot different than guy fights. A lot more hair pulling, cussing, scratching, and overall caddy-ness. This track gives a nice warning to what's about to really go down.</p><p></p><h2><a href=# class=text-word>DMX</a>- Ruff Ryders' Anthem</h2><p>Fight Night: 10 Songs To Make You Rowdy</p><p>Pretty much pick any DMX track, it will probably make the cut. His aggressive delivery along with hoarse voice speaks for itself. One of DMX's best tracks, "Ruff Rhyders' Anthem" showcases exactly why you&nbsp;shouldn't mess with him and his crew. "All I know is pain, all I feel is rain.&nbsp;How can I maintain, with mad shit on my brain.&nbsp;I resort to violence, my niggas move in silence."</p><p></p><p><h2>M.O.P.- Ante Up</h2></p><p>Fight Night: 10 Songs To Make You Rowdy</p><p>Talk about the ultimate hype song.&nbsp;"Ante Up" by M.O.P. brought the underground hip hop duo into mainstream light. A track that was released in 2000 but is to this day, 14 years later, a staple to everyone's "pump up" playlist. While the meaning of the song refers to their real lifestyle as part of a gang, the phrase "ante up" translates to "pay up, please!" And if you don't, the consequences will be severe.</p><p></p><p><h2>Crime Mob- Knuck If You Buck</h2></p><p>Fight Night: 10 Songs To Make You Rowdy</p><p>If you don't know this track, then, SMH. "Knuck If You Buck" is Crime Mob's hardest track, and will definitely get you going. The track itself is chock full of lines that promote&nbsp;rowdiness.&nbsp;Translation: Knuck means to hit someone with your knuckles, and Buck means getting ready to fight. Definitely&nbsp;a keeper.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p><h2>Eminem- Til I Collapse</h2></p><p>Fight Night: 10 Songs To Make You Rowdy</p><p>Nobody captures anger like Eminem does. Talk about rage and emotion, Em is your guy. "'Till I Collapse" is not only inspirational, but&nbsp;also eliminates quitting as an option. The intro itself is a personal message from Em that will get you motivated to never give up, to always keep pushing, and to never quit. He tells you to search deep within you for that inner strength, no matter how hard it gets.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p><h2>Chief Keef- 3 Hunna</h2></p><p>Fight Night: 10 Songs To Make You Rowdy</p><p>Not one hundred, or two. But THREE HUNNA. Chief Keef and his GBE crew don't play around. While most people may think he invented this catch phrase, it actually refers to the Black Disciples gang located in southside Chicago. Chief is no amateur to the street life, with the majority of his music dedicated to repping his&nbsp;crew and their loyalty for one another.</p><p></p><p><h2>D12- Fight Music</h2></p><p>Fight Night: 10 Songs To Make You Rowdy</p><p>Shoutout to <a href=# class=text-word rel>D-12</a>, this track is self-explanatory. Produced by Dr. Dre, "Fight Music" captures the essence of the lives of&nbsp;each member of the group, as they grew up on the streets of Detroit, Michigan. Violence and street fighting were not taken lightly. Eminem says it perfectly: "This kind of music, use it, and you get amped to do shit.&nbsp;Whenever you hear some shit and you can't refuse it."&nbsp;</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdiaoZ4gIyfoKCgpGK7qrPHrWRqaF2ovK%2Bz0marqGWdlrimediorGaqn6yxunnNnq6s</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./chuck-norris-net-worth-how-wealthy-is-the-martial-artist-actor.html><span>←</span><span>Chuck Norris net worth: how wealthy is the martial artist/actor?</span></a>
