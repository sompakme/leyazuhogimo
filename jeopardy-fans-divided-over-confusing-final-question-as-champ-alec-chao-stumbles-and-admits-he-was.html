News">More Jeopardy! News</h2><p>He then revealed the question: "In math, it's a rotated V; In society, it's a feeling of some marginalized or underrepresented people."</p><p>Each contestant had 30 seconds to submit their best guess with Ken, TK, looking to Michael for an answer first.</p><p>He guessed: "What is subdivision?" and lost $6,601 for being incorrect.</p><p>Alec, who moved into second place with $7,800, guessed: "What is inequality?"</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>He wagered and lost $4,801, bringing his winning for the day down to $2,999.</p><p>Tamara guessed: "What is less than?" which was, apparently, the right answer.</p><p>She added $1,801 to her total earnings, walking away with $15,601.</p><p>As she celebrated her victory, fans flocked to an <a href=# aria-label="online forum (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">online forum</a> to discuss the question.</p><p>Many seemed to think the Final Jeopardy question was a bit "rough," noting that there was an argument to be made that Alec's answer was correct.</p><h2>FANS REACT</h2><p>One commenter wrote: "Wow, I'm a bit surprised Tamara was the only one who got [Final Jeopardy]. And even though 'inequality' could be argued to be correct, it wouldn't have changed anything since he would have still lost and gotten [second]."</p><p>Another Jeopardy super-fan replied: "Personally, I don't see how it could be argued to be incorrect."</p><p>A third fan commented: "Yup, Alec's bet was too small. Wasn't big enough bet. But at the same time, I get why 'inequality' isn't accepted. As the math symbol of inequality didn't fit the brief due to the specificity required in the clue (I mean it doesn't resemble a rotated 'v' for one)."</p><p>Jeopardy contestant Michael even popped onto the Reddit thread to explain his own incorrect answer, saying: "Michael here. I read more into the FJ clue than was there and it was my undoing.</p><p>"I immediately knew that &lt; was 'less than' but I was trying to think of some single word that doesn't come up often. Once my brain got stuck looking for a single word instead of 'less than' I was screwed and couldn't get out of that hole."</p><p>Alec also made an appearance on the thread, explaining his misstep by saying: "Math has never been my strong suit, especially under pressure. I'm sure some of my former teachers will be screaming at the TV tonight!"</p><h2>CROWNING SOMEONE NEW</h2><p>Alec's reign as Jeopardy champ was short.</p><p>He took his first win during Thursday's episode of the show, dethroning returning three-day champ, Melissa Klapper.</p><p>While fans were happy for Alec, many were somewhat disappointed as Melissa was just one win away from being the&nbsp;<a href=#>first and technically only female</a>&nbsp;<a href=#>contestant</a>&nbsp;to qualify for the 2023&nbsp;<a href=#>Tournament of Champions</a>.</p><p>During the show, the <a href=#>returning Jeopardy competitor</a> faced off with Daisy Donohue, an actor and artist from St. Paul, Minnesota, and Alec.</p><p>Melissa works as a professor and is also a four-time book author and former ballerina from Merion Station, Pennsylvania.</p><p>She raked in $59,100 during her tenure on Jeopardy.</p><p>Many considered her a frontrunner and it looked like she would win going into Double Jeopardy! but she missed both Daily Doubles, betting $4,000 each.</p><p>Ken called it an "unfortunate" site, commiserating briefly with the contestant.</p><p>After her second miss, Melissa slumped her head and the down-turned mood in the audience was palpable.</p><p>With her floundering, Alec had a runway to victory as he headed into Final Jeopardy with $15,200 compared to Melissa's meager $6,800 and Daisy's $4,600.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>The Final Jeopardy question under "Movie Theme Songs" read: "Monty Norman, the composer of this character’s theme, said the staccato riff conveyed sexiness, mystery & ruthlessness."</p><p>Only Alec guessed correctly with "James Bond", adding a safe $305 and becoming the new winner with $15,505.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/03/fans-divided-confusing-final-question-805387414.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/03/fans-divided-confusing-final-question-805387420.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/03/contestant-makes-dumbest-wager-fans-804934723-2.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hvZ2aBdoKXaKGep6CWv6XFjJymp56lqLavs4yfoKeZnGK%2BtrHSraCopl2YtaK5z2aYpZ2TYrCprc5o</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./hazel-graye-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Hazel Graye Net Worth</span></a>
