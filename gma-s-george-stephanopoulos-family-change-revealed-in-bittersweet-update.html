Harper is studying in Nashville at Vanderbilt University, where George's GMA co-star Lara Spencer's daughter, Katherine, also attends.&nbsp;</p><p id=ecuQXkFvG4 data-wc=28><a class=hm-link href=#>Elliott had made an appearance on GMA</a> just this week, as George had been working in London to report of the Princess of Wales' cancer diagnosis for ABC.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a0626092e7ef-snapinstaapp4146926268775743343701056496699452658423546n1080.jpg><p id=e3ykWNOKN1 data-wc=45>Elliott joined her dad at the end of his live broadcast to the GMA studios, with George proudly announcing to his co-anchors Robin Roberts, Michael Strahan and Rebecca Jarvis: "Hey guys before you go, I have a special PA [production assistant] here in London today."&nbsp;</p><p id=e-JbFMP3Cv data-wc=82>Elliott, who per her dad is currently studying in London, briefly popped into the screen and gave a wave before quickly jumping out of frame, prompting George to say: "Oh no she got shy very fast!" She then jumped back in for another brief "hi" to the delight of her dad's co-hosts, as he joked: "I decided to put her to work today," while smiling ear-to-ear, and Robin quipped: "It's great to see even a glimpse of her… enjoy your time there."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/750e64e046af-george-stephanopoulos-ali-wentworth-harper-elliott.jpg><p id=eqwUGXbyiZ data-wc=59>The family are incredibly close and Ali previously gave an insight into their home life. Chatting to Harry Connick Jr, she said: "I have two girls. George is the only guy in the house. For some reason, he gets beat up constantly. He is always wrong. He is an idiot. He is a loser, but in a loving way."&nbsp;</p><p id=eCsU8aLxgw data-wc=58>It's been a big struggle for the couple to adjust to becoming empty nesters, and Ali previously opened up about how sad she felt when her youngest left home. At the time, Ali took to Instagram to post a number of photos of herself and George walking away from Harper's dorm on the college campus, hand in hand.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/8825d365683e-george-stephanopoulos-and-ali-wentworth-loved-up-on-a-boat.jpg><p id=e4VBEZTenu data-wc=22>"We dropped our baby off at college.

But… I don't think I'm ready!" she penned.&nbsp;</p><p id=ejTcVeGssu data-wc=35>"I don't want to stop making pasta with vodka sauce, picking up wet towels, cuddling up to her familiar scent. As Joni Mitchell once wrote – 'the bed's too big, the frying pan too wide'."&nbsp;</p><p id=eC9i1p66k1 data-wc=30>She continued: "I know our daughter will thrive. But man, it's brutal on the parents.
