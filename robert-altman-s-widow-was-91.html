They married that year and were together — with Kathryn serving as a welcoming presence on her husband’s movie sets — until his death in 2006 at age 81.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p>Altman was nominated for seven Academy Awards and received an honorary Oscar in 2006 “for a career that has repeatedly reinvented the art form and inspired filmmakers and audiences alike.”</p><p>For the past decade, his widow attended major Altman retrospectives at the Museum of Modern Art, the UCLA Film & Television Archive and at festivals throughout the world.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In 2014, she and critic&nbsp;<span data-scayt_word=Giulia data-scaytid=4>Giulia</span>&nbsp;<span data-scayt_word=D’Agnolo data-scaytid=5>D’Agnolo</span>&nbsp;<span data-scayt_word=Vallan data-scaytid=6>Vallan</span>&nbsp;published a scrapbook memoir titled Altman&nbsp;and served as the narrative thread in a feature-length documentary of the same name directed by Ron Mann.</p><p>“Our hearts are heavy to hear of Kathryn’s passing,” senior editor Eric <span data-scayt_word=Klopfer data-scaytid=7>Klopfer</span>&nbsp;of Abrams, her publisher, said in a statement. “We&nbsp;were&nbsp;thankful&nbsp;to have worked with and known her.&nbsp;She was a dynamo, a spitfire, a true original — and an essential figure in the history of American cinema — but most important, a warm, witty and <span data-scayt_word=overflowingly data-scaytid=8>overflowingly</span> generous and radiant person who enjoyed life to the very end.”</p><p>She also was the guiding force behind the establishment of the Robert Altman Collection at the University of Michigan’s Special Collections Library, also home to the Orson <span data-scayt_word=Welles data-scaytid=9>Welles</span> Collection.</p><p>More than 800 feet of material has been assembled, with plans for a touring exhibit. Included in the collection is The Kathryn Reed Story, a short film Altman made as a surprise birthday gift to his wife.</p><p>“While Kathryn Altman’s name does not appear in the credits of any of her husband’s films, the Altman collection is as much a tribute to her as it is to Bob himself,” Phillip <span data-scayt_word=Hallman data-scaytid=10>Hallman</span>, film studies field librarian at the University of Michigan, said in a statement. “Her presence led directly to her stewardship of his legacy, which she worked on tirelessly until the end.”</p><p>Born June 2, 1924, in Glendale, Calif., Altman joined the Earl Carroll troupe shortly after graduating from Hollywood High School. She appeared in many films as an extra.</p><p>Survivors include her children <span data-scayt_word=Konni data-scaytid=11>Konni</span>, Robert and Matthew; stepchildren Christine, Michael and Stephen; grandchildren Dana, Jonathan, Christopher, Reed, Parker, Christian, Alison, Jade, Cora, Charity, Wesley and <span data-scayt_word=Signe data-scaytid=12>Signe</span>; and nine great-grandchildren.</p><p>Arrangements are pending.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8yoraKdo2S6sMLInmSnnaeofKyt06GpsqZdp7KmsIyao62lkaN6pbHAnWSrp5Kav7V5l3BrcGpnZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ken-sugimori-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html><span>←</span><span>Ken Sugimori Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</span></a>
