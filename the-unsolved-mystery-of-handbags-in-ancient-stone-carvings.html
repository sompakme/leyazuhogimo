As stated on <a href=#>Ancient Origins</a>, "In ancient cultures from Africa to India to China, the figure of a circle was associated symbolically with concepts of spirituality or non-materiality, while that of a square was often associated with concepts of the Earth and of materiality." And so, "the image is used to symbolize the (re)unification of the earth and sky, of the material and the non-material elements of existence." <a href=#>Medium</a>, on the other hand, quotes non-mainstream historian Graham Hancock asking, "Could these containers (whether they are bags or buckets) be the symbols of office of an initiatic brotherhood — far traveled and deeply ancient, with roots reaching back into the remotest prehistory?"<a href=#><br></a></p><p><a href=#>International Business Times</a> asks, "Could these bags represent seeds that were preserved onboard the ark in some sort of vault, maybe they were distributed across the World as we repopulated the Globe after the Great Flood?"&nbsp;Finally, Ancient Origins also relates the potrepreneur's version, "When used in Assyrian art it is said the purse holds magic dust. When depicted in Olmec art they postulate it contains herbs for getting high."</p><p>So what's more reasonable: Any of these explanations, or that the handbags on the stone reliefs are, well, handbags?&nbsp;Not as fun? Sure. More realistic? Quite a bit. After all, if future historians find tons of pictures of people carrying handbags, we can assume they won't believe the bags are inexplicable alien devices.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCAk2xrcnFfqbWmedSnqqikppqxbrnYrKueqqlivKd5x5qlnZqRnMButc1mmKebmZq7tXnSraannV2YrrPCyKeerGc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-ideal-body-skincare-routine-according-to-dermatologists.html><span>←</span><span>The Ideal Body Skincare Routine, According to Dermatologists</span></a>
