The summer solstice has been observed for centuries in a variety of ways. However, Naked Hiking Day is a relatively new event.

However the association does advise walkers to budget between US$4000-8000 (NZ$6000-12000) for the five-month hike. No matter how hardy you are: at some point you are going to have to shell out for clothes, and I can imagine you will want to take out very comprehensive health insurance if you are doing the PCT in 'the buff'.</p><p>However from the Californian hills to the Southern hemisphere, it appears the opportunity to strip-off has been taken up by naturists around the world.</p><h2 class="related-articles__heading section-travel">Related articles</h2><p>The hashtags #hikenakedday and #hikenaked have had over a thousand submissions from Australia, Scotland, Switzerland even a couple of brave hikers in New Zealand.</p><p>Fortunately most trail-naturists restrict themselves to remote parts of tracks.</p><p>Yet for some walkers, Naked Hiking Day is every day.</p><p>Stephen Gough - better known as the "Naked Rambler" – brought the practice of "freehiking" to public attention with his attempts to walk the length of the UK naked.</p><p>The former Royal Marine was arrested multiple times for public indecency spending over six years in prison, after attempts to walk from Land's End in Cornwall to the top of Scotland.</p><p>He was released from jail in July 2011, only to be immediately rearrested for trying to leave the prison naked.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>The 'prisoner of conscience' has divided opinion with many newspapers and a play Who Bares Wins celebrating the Rambler as a hero of gymnosophic rights.</p><p>But let Gough be a caution to all would be trail nudists, keep your naturism for way out in nature.</p><p>Happy trails, until next year!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r8bHnqmapJRjsLB6zbNmraqRq7Kte9OhnGasopa2rXnLnqqsZZOkw6a%2BxJ1koqakmr%2BvrdOipqeZnGK1qrfEZqWao5WZeqWt2Gamp2WknbJuvMKtZpOQcmmkdJWnf4GDgXZ4f3WloYCEkYF5d5d1ew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-kerala-story-ott-release-date-saltlight-platform-everything-you-we-know-about-film.html><span>←</span><span>The Kerala Story OTT Release Date, Saltlight Platform: Everything You We Know About Film</span></a>
