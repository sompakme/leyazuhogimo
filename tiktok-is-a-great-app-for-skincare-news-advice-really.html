After five minutes of Disney lip syncs, I felt like a voyeuristic Methuselah. Scared I’d eventually get an “Ok Boomer” push notification, I archived the app and designated it in my mind as something for young people that enjoy choreography. I don’t sing and I don’t dance so, I figured, I didn’t need an app that highlighted these skills. It wasn’t until recently when a friend told me that there was a community of dermatologists using TikTok to educate the masses that I got off my proverbial lawn and back into the infinite scroll.</p><p>For the uninitiated, TikTok isn’t like other social apps—you don’t need to follow anyone to see content, so there’s no pressure to create; endless scrolling is encouraged. Unlike Snapchat, which emphasizes content creation by opening with a camera, or Instagram, where you need to follow people to generate your main feed, TikTok takes a page from streaming platforms. Upon opening the app, you're thrown into a “For You” page that auto-advances through content faster than Netflix with zero chill. This makes it extremely effective at keeping you captivated: think 14 year olds dancing, chefs cooking recipes, memes you'll send to your increasingly annoyed text thread, and, surprisingly, a growing community of dermatologists.</p><figure readability=1><p>Was this what accountability on a social media platform looked like?</p></figure><p>Wanting some control over my algorithm, I decided to look for doctors, chemists, and estheticians. I dove into TikTok’s endless personalized scroll knowing that every time I’d engage with skincare content, more posts about pores would populate. What I found was experts debunking skincare trends better than Reddit’s hallowed&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.cosmopolitan.com/style-beauty/beauty/a29429580/reddit-skincareaddiction/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Skincare Addiction</a>. Followed by only four other users and curious as to how I could use TikTok’s editing tools, I decided I would test filming a few things. This was a mistake.</p><p>Within a week, I had racked up more than 400,000 views and a lot of “thank you”s and “eff you”s regarding my&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.tiktok.com/@charlotteparler/video/6816726953119239430 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>retinol</a>&nbsp;journey, Bon Appetit’s&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.tiktok.com/@charlotteparler/video/6812739783379438854 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>lemon brown butter pasta</a>, and a video explaining the&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.tiktok.com/@charlotteparler/video/6812376014090407173 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>low molecular weight hyaluronic acid</a>. This last piece was my first skincare video, and while I was half joking with the title (I don’t actually think hyaluronic acid universally ruins skin), it’s how I learned there is no such thing as “test content” on TikTok. Anything can blow up depending on the blend of timing, trends, and hashtags you use. It’s for this reason that a growing community of dermatologists are making TikTok their platform of choice.</p><p>I first discovered Idaho-based dermatologist Dustin Portela (<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url="https://www.tiktok.com/@208skindoc?u_code=d4jecee69m8ma0&preview_pb=0&language=en&_d=d8l9hia83a1mg3&timestamp=1588196428&utm_campaign=client_share&app=musically&utm_medium=ios&user_id=6658837318265208837&tt_from=copy&utm_source=copy&source=h5_m" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>@208skindoc</a>) when I saw him “duet” with another TikTok user. (Dueting is when you post your own reaction to a video posted by another user.)&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.tiktok.com/@208skindoc/video/6810166231270837509 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>In this video</a>, he called out an influencer who didn’t fully understand the difference between cetyl alcohol and denatured alcohol (one is fatty and in most skincare products, the other can dry out and irritate skin). In a modern skincare world populated by an overwhelming amount of questionable advice and #ads, being privy to Dr. Portela's viewpoint was like entering a secret derm group text. I’ve seen doctors bemoan influencer culture and the irrational cult of clean beauty before, but this unfiltered correction was raw, direct, and more entertaining than tempered versions I’d seen on Instagram. Was this what accountability on a social media platform looked like?</p><a title=@208skindoc href=# data-url=https://www.tiktok.com/@208skindoc referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>@208skindoc</a><p>False advice is terrible for you #duet with @xomelissatovar #dermatologist #drama #skincare</p><a title="♬ original sound - Melissa Tovar" href=# data-url=https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-6799551418618366725 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>♬ original sound - Melissa Tovar</a><p>“Instagram remains a highly curated platform; TikTok is off the cuff,” Dr. Portela explains. Considering Instagram can at times feel like an aesthetic LinkedIn, it was a surprise to see Dr. Portela on TikTok in a wig made out of&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url="https://www.tiktok.com/@208skindoc?u_code=d4jecee69m8ma0&preview_pb=0&language=en&_d=d8l9hia83a1mg3&timestamp=1588196428&utm_campaign=client_share&app=musically&utm_medium=ios&user_id=6658837318265208837&tt_from=copy&utm_source=copy&source=h5_m#" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>paper towels</a>&nbsp;to playfully spoof influencers shilling expensive skincare across platforms. Recognizing the app's potential to reach people with humor and personality injected into education, he’s taught thousands of teens (and this 33 year old) how to take better care of their skin. As someone who writes about beauty and is in the early stages of getting my esthetician’s license, seeing science go viral is refreshing. Observing dermatologists have very human reactions to influencers praising&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.tiktok.com/@charlotteparler/video/6813374440043302150 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>essential oils</a>&nbsp;while bemoaning parabens feels like vindication. Where other platforms rarely hold creators accountable, watching doctors clarify what’s scientifically sound and what’s marketing speak in such a scalable and public way feels apropos in the age of COVID-19 conspiracy theories.</p><p>Dr. Joyce Park (<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url="https://www.tiktok.com/@teawithmd?lang=en" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>@teawithmd</a>), another dermatologist on TikTok, credits this kind of engagement as why she finally joined the app. While Instagram shows you curated content from people you follow, TikTok feeds you never ending content that’s based, in theory, on what you like. After five years on Instagram, Dr. Park has around 45,000 followers; just two months since joining TikTok, Dr. Park has more than 122,000 followers. Unlike myself and Dr. Portela, the dancing is what first attracted Dr. Park to the platform, she just makes sure to&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.tiktok.com/@teawithmd/video/6821622165968817413 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>teach people skincare tricks and debunk myths</a>&nbsp;along the way.</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.

That’s a dark and dystopian corporate charter. That said, in a world in which most influencers dwarf the followings of doctors and scientists, the accountability I see on TikTok is refreshing. How I frame content, making sure it’s clear where and how I source my information, is different from how I normally create content on other platforms. Also, it was nice to see content based on facts and science go viral, even if it’s just for the “youth.”<br></p><p>For more stories like this, including celebrity news, beauty and fashion advice, savvy political commentary, and fascinating features, sign up for the Marie Claire newsletter.</p><p><a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url="https://preferences.hearstmags.com/brands/MAR/subscribe.aspx?authId=F0CC0C27-80DA-4734-ABDF-E4115B84A56B&maj=WNL&min=UNDEF" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none><strong>subscribe here</strong></a><br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RopycpJGev6Z6wqikaJqVlsK1xY6aamtraWh%2Fcn2OraCkrJ%2BgerS3yKeamqqVYrGmvsyaq6ikn5y2tMCMramurJhk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./southern-charm-cast-net-worth-2024.html><span>←</span><span>Southern Charm Cast Net Worth 2024</span></a>
