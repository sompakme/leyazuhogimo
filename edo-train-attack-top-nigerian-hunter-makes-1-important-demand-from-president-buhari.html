In these countries, even in South Africa, the forests are protected by Forest Guards and Hunters.

It is the forests and farms."<p class=align-left>Waiting for its assent, Metchie said that one of the most effective ways to curb the menace of bandits and other terror activities, is to recruit, arm and empower young men and women as hunters and forest guards to make it difficult for criminals to operate from the forests.</p><p class=align-left>An African director of the International Association of <a href=#>World</a> Peace Advocates, Metchie added that when the bill is signed into law, the Hunters and Forestry Security Service would take over the protection and safeguarding of forests across the country.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/52f64549c3a6760a.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Buhari speaks on his last four months in office as president, sends important message to Nigerians</span></p></a><p class=align-left>According to Metchie who is also the Prime Minister of the Anambra State Association of Town Unions (ASATU), one of the greatest gifts President Buhari would leave for his successor, is to sign the Bill into law, as such would make the fight against insecurity easier for the new administration.</p><p class=align-left>He said:</p>"They take their victims to the forests because they are aware that there are no authorised security personnel there. When the bll is passed into law, it would empower the hunters and forest guards to bear arms, and motivate them to work and defend their fatherland, knowing that they have the backing of the government.“I believe that President Buhari is a patriotic citizen and a statesman.
