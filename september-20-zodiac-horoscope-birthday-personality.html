You are a doer rather than one who sits on the sidelines. You are always ready to take the initiative. And you never rest till you have completed the task on hand.</p><p>advertisement</p><p>advertisement</p><br><p>Some say that you are what people call an opportunist as you are always looking for ways to come up in the business world. This is not such a bad thing as everyone needs a mentor or someone they can come to for reliable advice.</p><p>The <strong>September 20 birthday personality</strong> has incredibly <a href=#>good judgment</a> when it comes to decorating, choosing a restaurant, people, and things of that nature. Also, you are practical and, you can handle almost any situation that comes your way.</p><p>Raised to have respect for others, you are concerned with the quality of life that your friends and family have. Although you may be “hard” to them, they appreciate your firmness as it only benefits them in the long run.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sunsigns.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/20-september-birthday-virgo.jpg alt width=350 height=350 sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The&nbsp;<strong>September 20 horoscope</strong> predicts that the biggest problem a person born on this day may have is admitting to mistakes. To grow, my dear Virgo, you need to learn from your errors instead of avoiding the fact that you could have been wrong. Until you can admit this, even if it’s just to yourself, you are doomed to repeat the same <a href=#>careless and silly</a> blunders.</p><p>advertisement</p><p>advertisement</p><h2><span>Personality</span></h2><p>This <a href=#>Virgo birthday</a> person is typically the bargain hunter. You know how to find a great deal and manage your money. You are a person who is sure of your ability to fix things including relationships. The September 20 zodiac shows that spirituality usually plays an important part in who you are and actually, you may have an interest in holistic healthcare, the <a href=#>supernatural, or the occult</a>.</p><p>Those who are born on this September 20th birthday and are career and goal-oriented may go to school for a long time trying to stay up to date on the ever-changing laws and regulations relating to professional growth. Having been a student, you have little trouble living within your means as you know your ship will eventually come in.</p><p>advertisement</p><p>advertisement</p><p>As a Virgo who is in love, you are easy to become too attached or you may let your feelings or your emotions run amok. The <strong>20 September astrology</strong> predicts that you can sometimes be obsessive-compulsive in matters relating to romance. When you do this, you tend to make people run away.</p><p>But you have to allow the person to get to know you first. With any luck at all, you will find someone who is much like you, and he or she will understand and accept this birthday <a href=#>personality trait</a>.</p><p>advertisement</p><p>advertisement</p><p>Too much, too soon can ruin a relationship that could be successful. Once you learn to calm down and take things one day at a time, you stand a chance of at least getting another date with that special someone and perhaps one day, you will have a lasting <a href=#>love relationship</a>.</p><h2><span>Characteristics</span></h2><p>As time goes on, this <strong>September 20 zodiac</strong> person may find themselves in a business partnership with their lover. This would be ideal if given <a href=#>acceptance and loyalty</a>. Typically, you desire and need an attraction outside of one that is merely physical. Your friends tell us that you have trust issues. With the number of people who call themselves “friends,” it is likely that you will find one who is not really on your side.</p><p>Naturally, you only trust those that you have as your close friends. If you are lucky enough to have a family, then this zodiac birthday person will not be found guilty of spoiling their kids. What your birthday says about you is that you will likely be stern parents who will teach their children to have superior ethics.</p><p>The <strong>September 20 birthday personality</strong> usually has good health practices. You work out, eat right and you could be a whiz in the kitchen. In addition to your physical health, you realize that a <a href=#>healthy mind</a> is in order.</p><p>You could be interested in holistic health care or the supernatural. It is not uncommon for someone born today to incorporate his spirituality into a lifestyle that uses meditation as a form of relaxation and motivation.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sunsigns.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/september20virgobirthdaycalendar.jpg alt="september 20 virgo birthday calendar" width=450 height=281 sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><h3><span><strong>Famous People And Celebrities Born On&nbsp;</strong></span><strong><span>September</span>&nbsp;</strong><strong><span>20</span></strong></h3><p>Asia Argento, Ian Desmond, Sophia Loren, Debbi Morgan, Deborah Roberts, <a href=#>Leo Strauss</a>, John Tavares</p><p>See: <a href=#><strong>Famous Celebrities Born On September 20</strong></a></p><h3><span><strong>This Day That Year – September</strong></span><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span><span><strong>20 In History</strong></span></h3><p><strong>1927</strong> – Tom Zachary throws Babe Ruth his 60th homerun hit of the season<br><strong>1951</strong> – The first time a jet crosses over the North Pole<br><strong>1955</strong> – Willie Mays bats 50 home runs in a season; he is the 7th person to <a href=#>reach this potential</a><br><strong>1975</strong> – The record by David Bowie, “Fame,” goes to the #1 spot</p><p><span>September</span><span>&nbsp;20</span>&nbsp;<a href=#>Kanya Rashi</a>&nbsp;<span>(Vedic Moon Sign)<br></span><span>September&nbsp;</span><span>20</span>&nbsp;<a href=#>Chinese Zodiac ROOSTER</a></p><h3><strong><span>Birthday Planet</span></strong></h3><p>Your ruling planet is<strong>&nbsp;<strong><span><a href=#>Mercury</a></span></strong> </strong>which symbolizes how you analyze the facts kept in front of you and express them.</p><h3><span><b>Birthday Symbols</b></span></h3><p><b></b><strong>The Virgin </strong>Is The Symbol For The Virgo Sun Sign</p><h3><span><b>Birthday Tarot Card</b></span></h3><p>Your Birthday Tarot Card is <a href=#><strong>Judgement</strong></a>.
