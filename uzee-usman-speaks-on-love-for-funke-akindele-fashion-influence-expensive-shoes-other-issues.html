She helped us to interpret our roles.<p class=align-left>He also spoke about<a href=#> his relationship with Funke</a>, saying:</p>"I knew her before the production of A Tribe Called Judah but we were not close. She is someone who appreciates people and speaks to them with respect. After the movie, we became very close and I love her very much because of the way she loves people around her."<h2>Simplicity influences Uzee's fashion sense</h2><p class=align-left>Speaking about what influenced his fashion sense and his<a href=#> favourite fashion accessories</a>, he said:</p>"Simplicity, being classy, and not doing too much influence my fashion sense. One can pass a message with one's fashion. I love expensive shoes and I wear caps a lot. My most expensive shoe costs $2,500 (N3.3m) and I bought it in the United States."<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/59553a3537677c0b.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>"I love earrings": Actor Boluwatife Adenisimi shares his fashion influence, creative impacts</span></p></a><h2>What are Uzee's thoughts on AMVCA nominations?</h2><p class=align-left>The role interpreter also lent his voice to the complaints by some fans that some deserving <a href=#>actors</a> were not nominated for the Africa Magic Viewers' Choice Awards (AMVCA). He said:</p>"I think the reason some people are complaining is because the award is focused on the viewers' choice. It is the movie the people love the most that the fans expect to be there. I understand that it is complicated at times because it is humans that are the judges. So, they are not perfect but they are trying. I am hopeful that A Tribe Called Judah will win some awards."<h2>Uzee Usman advises youths to learn skills</h2><p class=align-left><strong>Legit.ng</strong> earlier reported that Uzee had dropped <a href=#>words of advice</a> for graduates and youths in the country.</p><p class=align-left>According to the movie star, there are lots of <a href=#>people</a> in the queue for government jobs, so graduates should learn skills that will put food on their tables.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/8e97c237f2c67c90.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>"I dislike crocs": Actress Abigail Timothy shares beauty routine, fashion icon desire, other issues</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Usman listed skills like tailoring, carpentry, and blogging as alternative sources of livelihood for thousands of graduates in <a href=#>Nigeria</a>.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdksq%2FAxKurmqGeorKvwI6fmKygmaS7cH2UcW1taGJiwruxxGass6WRo3q0vMSaoqxlopq5osDIqKWsoJmleqfBzaScZpmbnrulscueZJ%2BZo522sLqMoqWfpKWau6Sxjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tina-sinatra-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Tina Sinatra Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</span></a>
