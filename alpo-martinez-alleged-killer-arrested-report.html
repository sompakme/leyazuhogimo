Police said they arrested and charged 27-year-old Shakeem Parker who allegedly harbored a grudge against Martinez for months&nbsp;over a road rage incident before fatally shooting the notorious kingpin. Sources said that Martinez, who was known to drive recklessly and dangerously close to pedestrians, hit Parker, who was on foot, with his motorcycle last summer.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The sources said that it was a "crime of opportunity" after Parker spotted Martinez pass by in a Dodge Ram. The prosecutors stated that Parker reportedly collected photos of Martinez and the crime scene from news reports.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Despite the impression that it could've been motivated by street politics, police tracked down both Martinez and Parker's movements prior to the shooting. The kingpin-turned-informant, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">who was played by Cam'ron in Paid In Full,</a> was partying at Legends Lounge on Halloween while Parker was at a Harlem deli where he was with his friends.&nbsp;“It looks like they were standing there in front, like, ‘There he is,’” the source said.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">We'll keep you posted on more details surrounding the case.&nbsp;</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Aron A. is a features editor for HotNewHipHop.
