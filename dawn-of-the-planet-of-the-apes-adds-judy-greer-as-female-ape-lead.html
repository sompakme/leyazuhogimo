The character of Cornelia was introduced in&nbsp;Rise of the Planet of the Apes&nbsp;and will be expanded in the film’s sequel. The character’s name was named after Cornelius (Roddy McDowall) from the original&nbsp;Planet of the Apes&nbsp;in 1969.</p><p>Greer will be performing the entire role via motion capture, just as Andy Serkis did in the previous film. In fact, Serkis was championing Judy Greer for the role as the two will be re-united after appearing together in the film 13 Going on 30.</p><p>Judy Greer is currently voicing the character of Cheryl Tunt on FX’s hilarious Archer animated series, and became well known for her role as Kitty Sanchez in Arrested Development. Greer will also be featured in the new Kimberly Peirce horror remake&nbsp;Carrie, which will be released later this year.</p><p>Dawn of the Planet of the Apes will tell the story of a group of scientists struggling to survive in the ruins of San Francisco, while also following Caesar as he tries to maintain dominance above the aware apes. The sequel film will also feature Kodi Smit-McPhee and Gary Oldman.&nbsp;Dawn of the Planet of the Apes will hit theaters everywhere on May 21, 2014.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2irk56zqnvDmq6nZaChrq%2Bx02aYqZ2jYq6lsNJmoa6cqWK0s7HEq2SfnZ2WuaZ5wKmcZqSVlrFvtNOmow%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./alpo-martinez-alleged-killer-arrested-report.html><span>←</span><span>Alpo Martinez Alleged Killer Arrested: Report</span></a>
