The process of discovering with somebody that you love that you don't work is so painful."</p><p>Despite the heartbreaking split, Kate insists she is still close to her ex-husband and claims being a single mother has forced her to grow up quickly.</p><p>She said: "Thank goodness I did it with Chris. We helped each other through it. Now we're both single and since the day we separated, we talk multiple times.</p><p>"This year was just an extremely giant sort of leap. I definitely feel like I've grown up a lot."</p><p>Following her split from Owen in June, Kate has been romantically linked to Dax Shephard and Orlando Bloom.</p><p>Owen was rushed to hospital on August 26 after being found unconscious with slashed wrists, just days after Kate was first photographed with Dax.</p><p>The <i>Wedding Crashers</i> star has since reportedly dated Jessica Simpson, supermodel Le Call and <i>Bionic Woman</i> star Michelle Ryan.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r8bHnqmapJRjsLB6zbNmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS4osDEZp%2BunKOku26%2Fz6KjpatdpLtuu9aepWavmaHAsLqMqZiippaquW6wyK%2Bmq5uVZJqbmJWRh42Jdox%2Fh36le3qAiXl4oYKUs3traA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./is-aaron-rodgers-part-owner-of-chicago-bears.html><span>←</span><span>Is Aaron Rodgers part owner of Chicago Bears?</span></a>
