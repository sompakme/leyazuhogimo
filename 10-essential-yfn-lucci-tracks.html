Though he is only two projects into his career, YFN Lucci is already gaining elite level notoriety and has the streets blazing.

In an interview with Hoodrich Radio just before the release of his debut mixtape Wish Me Well,&nbsp;the rapper commented on his humble beginnings in Summerhill saying, "You know, it's like growing up in any other hood man. We ain't have much but you know, we was tryna get it. I made sure, I'm gonna get it."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Check out the gallery and listen to 10 of the most important tracks from YFN Lucci, the voice of Summerhill.</p><p><br><h2>"Patience" Featuring Bigga Rankin</h2></p><p>10 Essential YFN Lucci Tracks</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The introductory track from his debut mixtape Wish Me Well&nbsp;is a chilling reminder of the long and tumultuous road YFN Lucci traveled in order to build the platform for his music. The video for "Patience" is dedicated to the rapper's fallen comrade Donovan "Nut" Thomas and chronicles Lucci's struggle to do right and patiently await his fame, while also defending the honor of himself and loved ones in the streets. This track is a great point of reference for YFN Lucci's edgy and rugged style of rap.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"></p><p>10 Essential YFN Lucci Tracks</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">YFN Lucci collected the 10 best tracks from his debut mixtape and re-released them as the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Wish Me Well EP</a>&nbsp;in June 2015. The project focuses on the stand-out songs of the mixtape and included records like "I Wonder Why" an introspective street anthem that showcases Lucci's signature trap-leaning, crooning infused style. The original record that appeared on the mixtape featured Skooly but the version that was released on the EP features assistance from Yo Gotti.

He has done a great job of staying creative and developing his sound all while giving the fans what they want and expect from him. "Destined" is the first track off of his&nbsp;Wish Me Well 2 project and is a great example his consistency, and the added cosign from Southern legend Bigga Rankin proves Lucci's dedication to the streets.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"></p><p><h2>"Exactly How It Was"</h2></p><p>10 Essential YFN Lucci Tracks</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>"Exactly How It Was" Featuring <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Rich Homie Quan</a></strong></p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Before his lawsuit with Think It's A Game Records (TIG)</a>, Rich Homie Quan was busy churning out hits and being recruited for a slew of features. Some of the highlights of his time with TIG were alongside YFN Lucci and "Exactly How It Was" from Lucci's Wish Me Well mixtape is a great example of the great chemistry the two rappers have.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"></p><p><h2>"Talk That Shit"</h2></p><p>10 Essential YFN Lucci Tracks</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Here goes another cut from YFN Lucci's Wish Me Well 2 mixtape.

He released a couple loose remixes in anticipation of his Wish Me Well 2 project that featured him playing with styles and putting his unique spin on classic songs. Lucci's take on Beanie Sigel's timeless track "Feel It In The Air" is the first of the pair of tracks that add to the rapper's&nbsp;repertoire.</p><p><h2>"56 Nights"</h2></p><p>10 Essential YFN Lucci Tracks</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">This track serves as the second of the pair of remixes mentioned in the previous slide and echoes the elements of versatility and style and also pays homage to a rap legend.

"Call Log" is the perfect representation of what trap love sounds like.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"></p><h2>"Key To The Streets (Remix)" Featuring <a href=# class=text-word>2 Chainz</a> & Lil Wayne</h2><p>10 Essential YFN Lucci Tracks</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Possibly one of the biggest records from YFN Lucci's Wish Me Well 2 project was the track "Key To The Streets" featuring the <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Migos</a> and Trouble. The original version of the song tore the streets up and the added verses from 2 Chainz and Lil Wayne on the remix gives the track even more momentum.

Both artists did big things in 2016 and what better way to end the year with an even bigger record. The track currently has over four million plays on Soundcloud and sounds like a certified hit. This record followed up his monster track "Keys To The Streets" with equal momentous&nbsp;buzz and truly captures the raw potential and appeal that YFN Lucci has to offer. Plus PnB Rock and Lucci go together insanely well so it's only right that we end the list with this banger.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Get lit to this super turnt track from the rappers and listen to <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">"Ammunition"</a>&nbsp;from YFN Lucci's upcoming EP Long Live Nut if you find yourself yearning for more music from the rising Atlanta rap star.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdlbH92hIxqZ2ado6iyr8DImqNmsZajeq3BwpygZqyilrCsv4ynnLCr</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./why-do-girls-marry-trees.html><span>←</span><span>Why do girls marry trees?</span></a>
