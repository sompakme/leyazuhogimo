They simply didn’t have the ability to take it out of the rotation that swiftly. Dave Meltzer noted on <a href=#>Wrestling Observer Radio</a> that it takes a bit of time for advertisements to really go away due to how they are set up.</p><p>“They still had the commercial tonight on RAW. They pulled it, but you can’t pull it immediately. You know it takes a couple of days. I saw it over the weekened a couple of times, and I saw it during RAW.”</p><p>Odds are fans will see less and less of that CarShield campaign as time goes by. Very soon fans might never see them again. The company did not specify how long they are pausing the campaign, but this heat on the two-time WWE Hall of Famer <a href=#>doesn’t seem to be letting up.</a></p><p><strong>What’s your take on this story?
