Most of the professionals in the movie industry aren't like this; those who are usually aren't as terrible as the cliche makes them out to be. But they do exist. Early in his career, Van Damme was one of those actors.</p><p>Van Damme, the living splits factory, thought his superhuman flexibility and "unique" acting style were worth more than he was being offered in a film deal following the success of Timecop. He was only being offered a three-film deal at $12 million –&nbsp;per film. Why Hollywood would ever try to cheat him with such a lowball offer (#sarcasm), we'll never know. Van Damme wasn't happy about it, so he demanded $20 million. His reasoning was that Jim Carrey was making that much, so he should, too. Which makes total sense if you like comparing apples to puppies or, say, comparing a guy who's known (according to the <a href=#>Orlando Sentinel</a>) for injuring&nbsp;his co-actors to a guy who's a comedy legend. The studio hung up on Van Damme and <a href=#>the offers stopped rolling in</a>. As he told <a href=#>The Express</a> in 2011,&nbsp;"I made a bad mistake and I was on the blacklist in Hollywood for years."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB%2Bk21ubnBfqbWmedGemKynnmK1sLjLsq6op5Rirre7yJ2cnWWamq6vecKlmK6clWLDorqMnZimpZVis7C%2BjLKcmqqjZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./stan-lee-does-have-a-guardians-of-the-galaxy-cameo-that-sneaky-rascal.html><span>←</span><span>Stan Lee Does Have A Guardians Of The Galaxy Cameo, That Sneaky Rascal</span></a>
