She has always had the staunch opinion that <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">none of them deserve to be with her son</a>. Her stance continues to grow stronger, after Blueface's recent jail call.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In the audio clips below, Blueface requests that a close friend of his to call Chrisean Rock. However, he does not refer to her as that. He asks to speak to his "wife." In the ensuing audio Rock continuously addresses him as "daddy" throughout Blueface's jail call and how much she was<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color"> waiting for his phone call.</a> This eventually got around quick enough for Karlissa to react with another "I told you so" tone.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-blueface-s-jail-call-is-just-jail-talk>Blueface's Jail Call Is Just "Jail Talk"</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In the final clip, she calls out her son for calling her "wife" when he "won't even the let the baby call you daddy." Additionally, Karlissa says that Blueface should take ownership of the child and then "maybe we will believe some of this s***." In the end, she says that is just "another promotion for the circus" and that it is "a hot f*****g mess." Fans were in agreeance but still have trepidations about how many times she has been right. For example, one comment reads, "Karlissa had been right too many time for comfort. Ion like agreeing with this woman."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">What are your thoughts on Blueface and Chrisean Rock referring to each other as "wife" and "daddy" on his jail call?
