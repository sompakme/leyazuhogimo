Just two years earlier, he secured the $100K winner-takes-all World Series of Pro Mod.</p><p>However, the racer‚Äôs parachutes failed at Gateway Motorsports Park in September 2018, which led to him falling into the <a href=# rel=nofollow>sand trap</a>. He also crashed his Chevelle during the Four Wide Nationals at Z-Max.</p><p>The Street Outlaws star raced twice at the <a href=# rel=nofollow>Action Sprint Tour</a>, and has only improved his rankings over the years. At the 2016 Super DIRTcar Big-Block Modified Series, he placed 49th, before jumping to the top just a year later.</p><p>He has been spotted on Street Outlaws since 2021, and fans are now wondering how much he is worth. His team recently won the race against NOLA on the February 15th 2022 episode.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-facebook wp-block-embed-facebook"><a href=#>Team California | Street Outlaws: No Prep Kings</a><p>Team California is here to takeover üò§üö®: #StreetOutlaws: No Prep Kings & Street Outlaws: Team Attacküóì: Monday + Tuesday ‚è∞: 8:00p ETüì∫: Discovery</p>Posted by <a href=#>Street Outlaws</a> on Monday, October 18, 2021</figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-street-outlaws-mike-s-net-worth>Street Outlaws: Mike‚Äôs net worth</h2><p>Mike is thought to be worth $500K in 2022. As he became a cast member on Street Outlaws in 2021, in the show‚Äôs No Prep Kings series, it‚Äôs likely his net worth increased due to his new TV presence.</p><p>The racer, who is part of Team Cali, is estimated to earn&nbsp;around $20,000 to $30,000 per episode. Pilgrim Studios reportedly pays Big Chief $20,000 per episode that makes it to air.</p><p>Pay checks are likely to vary for each show, depending on how popular they are. Mike doesn‚Äôt often race on the series, so it is possible he may not be paid as much as the more famous cast members, such as Bobbie and Brandon James.</p><p>Mike recently paid tribute to his late friend Wayne Smozanek, who appeared on the show alongside him, but sadly passed away after battling Covid in ICU. He wrote on <a href=# rel=nofollow>Facebook</a>:</p><p>My condolences to Wendy and the entire Smozanek family. We will all miss Wayne, he was one of the kindest persons I have ever met. I enjoyed my time racing with him and he has been in my thoughts. It makes me sad to know that he will be gone but not forgotten!

A follower in the comments revealed he had sold the memorable wheels.</p><p>He revealed he needs to make room for a new car, namely the NPK Chevelle.</p><p>Over 60 fans commented on the post in which Mike was selling the car. One wrote: ‚ÄúMike, you make us all proud to know you and your team. Great job this last season at NPK.
