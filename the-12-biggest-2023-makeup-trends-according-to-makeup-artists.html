<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>The 12 Biggest 2023 Makeup Trends, According to Makeup Artists</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Say "‘80s makeup" and my mind goes straight to neon everything. The '90s? Overlined lips—easy. Early 2000s? Frosted shadow and Juicy Tubes—the end. <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/makeup-trends-2022/>Makeup trends</a> have and always will have a huge impact on their respective eras, and 2023 is no exception. “This year is all about the ism; minimalism and maximalism. There is no in between,” says makeup artist and executive director of creative beauty at Too Faced <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=#>Elyse Reneau</a>. “You are either simplifying and going for the effortlessly gorgeous aesthetic or leaning into bright colors, metallic shifting pigments and glitter in unexpected ways for an instant dopamine hit.”&nbsp;</p><p>The extremes are taking shape in a wide range of looks. On the one hand, there’s the underpainting <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/g3283/best-foundation/>foundation</a> technique, which was coined by Mary Phillips and made possible by the launch of dozens of lightweight, sheer coverage formulas. “We’re finally embracing skin and products that enhance our skin and leave a skin-like finish versus aiming to have a more full-coverage finish,” says celebrity makeup artist and CCO of CTZN Cosmetics <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=#>Sir John</a>. “The vibe is definitely much more natural, dewy, and fresh.” &nbsp;</p><p>On the other end of the spectrum comes intense lips and eyes—and the bolder the better. There’s a hint of grunge going on, lip liner is all the range, and shimmer has a spot on the stage. “We are definitely seeing makeup trends circling back around from the '90s and early 2000s,” says makeup artist <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=#>Tobi Henney</a>. “There are lots of brown-toned lips, white eyeliner has made a comeback, pastel blues are big, and feline cat eyes are back.”&nbsp;</p><p>To get a more intense breakdown of the 2023 makeup trends, along with some tips from the pros, scroll ahead and prepare to screenshot.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-the-french-riviera-face><span>The “French Riviera” Face</span></h2><p>Coming off the heels of Sofia Richie's wedding extravaganza and the Cannes Film Festival, it's no surprise that French Riviera-inspired makeup looks are taking over the summer beauty scene. Think: Fresh skin and a bold lip. "Start with a weightless complexion using a sheer tint or opt for just a dab of concealer where needed," says makeup artist <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=#>Jason Hoffman</a>. "Apply a liberal amount of bronzer to give the effect of a rich tan and finish with a sultry, high-impact matte lip. My current favorite, the <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=#>Rose Inc Lip Cream in Mortal Flame</a>, is a new vivid coral that pops against the warmth of a tanned complexion. It all gives the vibe of yachting in the French Riviera."</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-cloud-skin><span>Cloud Skin</span></h2><p>"Soft focus skin with natural radiance is definitely having a moment," says makeup artist and beauty brand founder <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=#>Danessa Myricks</a> says about summer makeup trends. "The key to get into the Cloud Skin trend is by tapping into that delicate balance of a refined, natural matte finish to the skin while preserving a life-like<strong>,</strong> skin-like dimension." Achieving the look lies heavily in the skincare stage, so start with a hydrating serum and seal the deal with a second skin foundation and soft-focus, blurring blush. "My go-to products are the <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=#>Yummy Skin Glow Serum </a>paired with <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=#>Yummy Skin Blurring Balm Powder</a>."</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-bold-blurred-blush><span>Bold, Blurred Blush</span></h2><p>“People have been wanting more and more <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/makeup/a19860598/best-blush/>blush</a> and I am here for it,” says <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=#>Sara Smith</a>, Bobbi Brown Cosmetics National Makeup Director. “It’s the perfect way to build natural warmth on the skin.” Textures will continue to be uber-creamy and blendable (the <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=#>Bobbi Brown Pot Rouge</a> is a favorite), with the new addition of blurring formulas that make pores disappear. As Reneau puts it, “Filters may be out, but looking like your skin is filtered will be in—in a really big way.” To get the look, she recommends <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=#>Too Faced’s Cloud Crush Blush</a>, “which has blurring technology that softens pores and texture.”&nbsp;</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more. Sign up here.</p><p>As for <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/how-to-apply-blush/>how to apply blush</a> this year? Steer away from applying product on the center of the face and go for a more sculpted look. “Blush placement will shift away from high up on the cheekbone and do more of a sculpting thing on the apples of the cheeks, wrapping it underneath the cheekbone,” says Half Magic founder and lead Euphoria makeup artist <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=#>Donni Davy</a>. &nbsp;</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-soft-focus-skin><span>Soft Focus Skin</span></h2><p>Everyone from Makeup by Mario to Kosas and <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=#>Jason Wu Beauty</a> has come out with light coverage, barely-there formulas in recent weeks—and it’s right on cue. “Clean girl makeup was popular last year, but barely-there complexion is going to be popular this year,” predicts <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=#>Jason Wu</a>, fashion designer and founder of Jason Wu Beauty. “People aren’t as interested in those full-coverage foundations and are swappling them out for skin tints or nothing at all.” This adoption of lighter, serums and tints goes hand in hand with embracing imperfections. Davy says, “We’re going to see more real skin. There’s less acne scar shaming and more of an unapologetic attitude about breakouts—especially when breakouts are coexisting with cool makeup.”&nbsp;If you're in the market for a dewy serum, allow us to direct your attention to the <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=#>Philosophy Dose of Wisdom Bouncy Skin Reactivating Serum</a>. &nbsp;It'll leave your complexion with a reflective, radiant finish that's right in line with the soft focus trend.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-pop-on-the-pout><span>Pop on the Pout</span></h2><p>‘Tis the era of bold lips. “Bold lips are back and can stand alone. Pair this trend with clean fresh skin and a groomed brow,” says Smith. In addition to rich reds, browns, berries, and mauve lipstick shades, it’s important to call out that lip liner is going to have a major moment too. On the one hand, there’s going to be a resurgence of using a lip liner that’s a shade or two deeper than your actual lipstick. One the other, lip liner is going to be used in place of lipstick altogether. Wu recommends using his <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=#>Stay In Line Lip Liner </a>all over the base. It can be worn solo, or, if you decide to layer lipstick on top, will make your color last longer. &nbsp;</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-brow-experimentation><span>Brow Experimentation</span></h2><p>Bleached brows have continued to dominate runways, Julia Fox continues to rock the look, and according to Davy, it’s not going anywhere any time soon. “The bleached brow is having a moment and I think it's given people the confidence to experiment more with their brows. I’m thinking we’ll see a lot more thinly plucked eyebrows and people experimenting with the shape of their brows. Maybe even people swinging in the opposite direction and going for dark and thin brows.”&nbsp;</p><p>Just don’t pluck away unless you’re *really* sure you want to get onboard the thin eyebrow train—there’s no going back. “I think it's important to ask yourself: Do I want thin eyebrows forever? Because that is what you are deciding when you start tweezing your brows,” warns Reneau. “Instead, I am leaning into the lifted and arched trend—let’s call it glamination. It's lifted (but not straight up!), and defined and natural looking.”</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-subtle-shimmers><span>Subtle Shimmers</span></h2><p>“Whether it's chrome, metallic, or a sheer wash of shimmer, sparkle will be back in a big way this year,” confirms Smith. “What I love about this trend is you can wear it in so many different ways.” Do a soft wash of sparkle across your eyelid (we rounded up the <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/g35321220/best-glitter-eyeshadows/>best glitter eyeshadows</a>!) or up the ante with a straight up metallic liquid (I love the <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=#>Half Magic Glitter Pill</a> for this). Essentially, have fun and party on.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-the-cat-eye-resurgence><span>The Cat Eye Resurgence</span></h2><p>“The eyes are your canvas for self-expression this year and you don’t have to be an artist to get creative,” says Reneau. “Using a <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/best-liquid-eyeliners/>liquid liner</a>, like <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=#>Better Than Sex </a>which has a super sharp tip, lets you easily create double winged liner, faux lower lashes, and feline inner corners that will draw attention right to the windows of your soul.” In short: Eyeliner is back to being beginner friendly. Impossible-to-do graphic eyeliner is taking a backseat in favor of kitten flicks and classic cat eye wings. (Pro tip: “When applying your eyeliner, be sure to pull it upward and outward,” says Smith.)&nbsp;</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-grunge-glam><span>Grunge Glam</span></h2><p>Chalk it up to Wednesday-core or call it a makeup evolution, but grunge glam is where it’s at this year. For some, that may look like a deep lip. “Edgier, everyday makeup, like a more elevated version of Wednesday Addams makeup is big,” says Davy, noting that plum stains, burgundy lip creams, and dark brown glosses are going to have a moment. “It’s a more fierce everyday look that is less about being soft and pretty and more about embracing your edgier side.”&nbsp;</p><p>If you want to translate the trend to your eye makeup, take a page out of celebrity makeup artist <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=#>Dani Parkes</a>’ playbook. “Put on black eyeliner and then wash your face—it’s perfect for going out if you don’t want to wear a lot of makeup,” she says. “It’s going to sharpen the color of your eye and make your lashes look better. It gives you that ‘90s glam look.”&nbsp;</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-underpainting><span>Underpainting</span></h2><p>We’re only a few weeks into 2023 and underpainting, a term coined by makeup artist Mary Phillips, has already gone viral. “Start by applying your <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/best-concealers/>concealer</a> and contour before foundation to easily achieve this look,” Parkes explains. “It defines your natural features and brings out your natural, glowing skin. The less makeup, the better.” While the excitement around the technique may be new, it’s been in makeup circles for years. The technique is commonly used on stars like Hailey Bieber, <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/kendall-jenner/>Kendall Jenner</a>, and <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/jennifer-lopez/>Jennifer Lopez</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-faux-freckles><span>Faux Freckles</span></h2><p>This goes hand in hand with the beauty community’s preference for lightweight foundation. If you don’t have any freckles to shine through, why not draw them on a la Alix Earle? “It makes your nose look smaller and your makeup look more natural,” says Parkes. “The best product to use for this is <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=#>Freck</a>. It’s a fake freckle serum that looks real when applied.” Just poke on a few dots and diffuse the product with your finger.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-dopamine-glam><span>Dopamine Glam</span></h2><p>In the same way that dopamine dressing dominated 2022, we’re going to see dopamine makeup leading the charge in 2023. “People are craving color in their beauty beats,” says Sir John. “Whenever I’m working on a client and looking to make them feel confident and to set their vibrations high, I use color.” This can take the form of denim liner, a dark red lip (Sir John love the <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=#>CTZN Cosmetics’ Code Red </a>collection), or funky eyeshadow.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-meet-the-makeup-artists><span>Meet the Makeup Artists</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg><span class=person__name>Elyse Reneau </span><a class=button-social href=# aria-label=INSTAGRAM><span class=button-social__icon></span></a><a class=button-social href=# aria-label=LINKEDIN><span class=button-social__icon></span></a>Makeup Artist and Executive Director of Creative Beauty<p>Elyse Reneau is an accomplished makeup artist with more than 20 years of experience in the industry.
