She started out as a model who was frequently dismissed because of the gap in her teeth before securing a 1973 modeling contract — the biggest in the history of the industry at the time, in addition to kick-starting an acting career. Decades later, Hutton is 78 and still modeling, embracing unconventional beauty, and looking absolutely wonderful.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Speaking with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Harper's Bazaar</a>, the Strivectin global ambassador went through her very bare-bones beauty routine and shared that the brand's <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">S.T.A.R Light Retinol Night Oil</a> is one of the few products she uses. The oil, which Hutton says "does really good things for your skin" is packed with retinol (as its name implies), hydrating and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>softening squalane</a>, antioxidants, and chia seed oils that strengthen the skin barrier.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shop now:</strong> $99; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">skinstore.com</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">dermstore.com</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">ulta.com</a>, and <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">amazon.com</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It's a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>nonirritating dose of retinol</a> (according to the brand), and has over a thousand five-star ratings across retailers. A 61-year-old five-star shopper wrote that although they have their "fair share of both lines and creases," they "constantly receive compliments" on their skin. A 74-year-old fan of the product also highly recommended the oil, describing it as "very effective and light." Another happy customer called this "the best product I've used in my entire life,"adding that they were considering Botox but found <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Strivectin's Retinol Oil</a> to have the same effect.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A few shoppers described this retinol night oil as a "holy grail" product. One added, "I do have more wrinkles under and at the edges of my eyes than I would like to." After a month of use they said, "the wrinkles on my forehead are gone almost entirely and [those] underneath my eyes have gone down about 60 percent."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">An icon of age-positivity and staying true to yourself, a recommendation from Lauren Hutton is not to be taken lightly. According to the model and shoppers, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Strivectin S.T.A.R. Light Retinol Night Oil</a> is worth the splurge.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wZ6YrqypZLmiwdGepWagpanBsLqMrKuroaaasLW1zWapnqyZo7ytec2inqGsXaS2rQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./katie-piper-equality-for-women-is-something-we-should-all-want.html><span>←</span><span>Katie Piper: 'Equality for women is something we should all want'</span></a>
