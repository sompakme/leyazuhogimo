In a caption-less photo shared to her grid, Kourtney held onto the Blink-182 drummer's tattooed hand while sitting in the front seat of a car.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>April 2021: Travis Barker got Kourtney Kardashian's name tattooed on his chest.&nbsp;</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Travis declared his love to Kourtney in the most public (and painful) way possible and tattooed her name in a cursive font on his chest — just above his left nipple, to be exact. This was the second of two Kourtney-inspired tattoos. The first was a doodle of the phrase "you're so cool" in what appeared to be Kourtney's handwriting on his upper thigh. The tattoo was assumed to be a reference to the title song in the 1993 film&nbsp;True Romance — one of the couple's favorite movies.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>August 2021: Travis Barker takes his first flight with Kourtney Kardashian since surviving his 2008 plane crash.</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On August 15, 2021, Travis flew for the first time in thirteen years since a deadly 2008 plane crash left the drummer with third-degree burns on more than half of his body. He and Kourtney traveled to Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, on Kylie Jenner's private jet before they made their way to Europe, visiting both Italy and Paris.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Travis revealed that he never planned on flying again until he started dating Kourtney during an interview with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Nylon</a> the following month.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It's still something very new to me, but having something that gives me the strength and hope to be able to overcome things that were so traumatic in my life, it just says a ton," he said. "[Kourtney]'s definitely that for me. I'm invincible when I'm with her. It's just like I never dreamed.

Matching in all-black outfits, the couple took their PDA to the next level and touched tongues, which would later become their signature move, as they stopped for photos.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>October 2021: Kourtney Kardashian and Travis Barker are engaged.</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Travis asked Kourtney to marry him in Montecito, California, at the Rosewood Miramar Hotel on the beach while they were surrounded by hundreds of roses and candles. Capturing the romantic moment on Instagram, Kourtney shared several photos from the proposal, writing "forever" in the caption and tagging her new fiancé. Afterward, they joined Kourtney's family and Barker's kids — Landon, Alabama, and Atiana — for a celebratory dinner back at the resort.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>April 2022: Kourtney Kardashian and Travis Barker have a "practice" wedding in Las Vegas.&nbsp;</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Following their loved-up appearance at the 2022 Grammy Awards, Kourtney and Travis had an impromptu wedding at the One Love Wedding Chapel, where they were married by an Elvis impersonator. Kourtney later revealed that they didn't obtain a marriage license before the ceremony, sharing on Instagram: <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>"Practice makes perfect."</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On an episode of The Kardashians, Kourtney revealed that she was "black-out drunk" during the wedding. "I blacked out," Kardashian told her good friend Simon Huck while filming the show. "I didn't even remember Elvis, like, sang to me walking down the aisle. I didn't remember I had a bouquet." The Poosh founder then shared what she did remember from her wild night. "I did throw up after, though, and took my top off and unbuttoned my pants," she added during a confessional. "I had to walk back through the hotel with a million people taking my photo. I was a hot slob kabob."&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>May 2022: Kourtney Kardashian and Travis Barker get married — again.&nbsp;</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On May 15, 2022, Kourtney and Travis got legally married at the courthouse in Santa Barbara. Kourtney's grandmother, Mary Jo "MJ" Campbell, was there as a witness, as was Travis's dad, Randy. The civil ceremony took place just a week before their lavish nuptials in Portofino, Italy, that spanned several days.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"When we talk about our wedding to our kids, we're not gonna be like, 'Oh, we just got married in Los Angeles, or we just got married in the desert or San Francisco or Utah.' It had to be Italy, Portofino," Travis said on the couple's Hulu wedding special Til Death Do Us Part.
