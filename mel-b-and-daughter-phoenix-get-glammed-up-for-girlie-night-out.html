She matched her famous mum with a black clutch but added a pop of colour to her look with blue streaks in her hair. The duo looked to be enjoying their girlie evening out as they shared a few laughs before the musical, which is loosely based on Memphis DJ Dewey Phillips, one of the first white DJs to play black music in the 1950s. Mel B and her 15-year-old daughter were in good company, with the former Spice Girl <strong>taking to Instagram</strong> to share a photo of the pair backstage with the star of the show <strong>Beverley Knight</strong>.</p><p id=ehehXdG6xELA data-wc=14>Other celebrities who attended the premiere included <strong>Lindsay Lohan</strong>, Vanessa Feltz and Nigel Harman.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/8eda4621d765-beverley-knight-insta-z.jpg><p id=eSeoEErAnOfF data-wc=12><strong>Mel B and Phoenix met star of the show Beverley Knight backstage</strong></p><p id=e96sDYNu8Fm4 data-wc=105>Mel B's post came just a few hours after the <a class=hm-link href=#>X Factor</a> judge paid tribute to her eldest child, posting a photo of Phoenix <a class=hm-link href=#>glammed up for the MOBO awards</a> and kissing her mum on the cheek. "Ahhhhhh phoenix I'm speechless <strong>makin me cry right now</strong>," Mel B wrote alongside the snap. Her mini-me shared the same shot on her <strong>Instagram page</strong>, praising Mel B for all her hard work. "I honestly can't tell you how proud I am of this woman," wrote Phoenix. "I'm speechless of how hard she's worked... her whole life," before adding, "I'm so glad to call her my mother."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/21a7e00f0cf3-phoenix-insta-z.jpg><p id=e6149TAxdGvR data-wc=12><strong>Phoenix praised her mum Mel B for working hard 'her whole life'</strong></p><p id=eOjVc8hi6UTH data-wc=85>Mel B and Phoenix's evening at the theatre comes just a day after the singer co-hosted the MOBO awards ceremony at London's SSE Wembley Arena. At the star-studded affair <strong>Jessie J</strong>, who won an award for best female, kicked off the show with a medley of her hits and and spoke about how "fulfilling" the past year had been. But the evening's big winner was <strong>Sam Smith</strong>, who scooped no fewer than four gongs, including best male artist and best album.</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
