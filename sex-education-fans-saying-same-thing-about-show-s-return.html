A truly unrivalled show that has done more to normalise female pleasure than real life sex ed ever has. Aimee is forever my favourite."</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: Sex Education season four trailer</figure><p id=ewDCLNUtepZ data-wc=97>Another person added: " I had the pleasure of previewing #SexEducation’s final series in full. I found it a little disjointed at first, but things soon smoothed out. Episode 6, in particular, was remarkably well done. Fans are in for a treat." A third person posted: " Absolutely loved the final season of #SexEducation, which goes out as funny, warm, and sexy as it has the previous 3 seasons. Only quibble? Even with some great closure, it feels like there's a lot more life left in the show, and it could go on for many seasons more."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/93351686039b-se401unit00675rt.jpg><p id=eAZZrJe93Kb data-wc=64>However, not everyone was keen, with one reviewer adding: "The final season of #SexEducation is my least favourite. I get what they were going for, but the end result is far more disjointed than it needed to be. Saying that, it’s still better than 90% of shows and there are so many scenes that made me laugh or cry or just moved me deeply."</p><h3 class="factBoxTitleClass_f1xis0ve hm-heading">Awesome TV shows coming in Autumn 2023</h3><p id=ezwj7eXE-G>Sex Education season 4, Netflix - 21 September&nbsp;</p><p id=eeDCBYRCDn>Still Up, Apple TV+ - 22 September</p><p id=e-WX9pGIIc>Gen V, Amazon Prime Video - 29 September</p><p id=eL60R8_n4c>Loki season 2, Disney+ - 6 October</p><p id=eBvtj7v-EQ>Lessons in Chemistry, Apple TV+ - 13 October</p><p id=efr6kyl4GL>The Fall of the House of Usher, Netflix - 12 October</p><p id=eo2QIXRFmB>All the Light We Cannot See, Netflix - 2 November</p><p id=ejCHpnHqcY>The Buccaneers, Apple TV+ - 8 November<br></p><p id=eR8nezsj7l6 data-wc=58>The final season sees Otis, Eric and some of their fellow Moordale students head to Sixth Form college after the school is closed, while Maeve is studying in the US, Jean is struggling to juggle life with a newborn, and Adam is deciding what to do with his life after deciding not to continue his education at school.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
