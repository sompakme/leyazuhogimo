The actor <a href=#>told</a> Men's Health that he was "addicted" to the changes he was seeing in his body. As for dealing with cravings, Ferrara says, "Whenever I have a craving, I go and have it and just make sure I don’t have it again the next day."</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.9620253164557><h2>Jimmy Kimmel</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/jimmy_kimmel.jpg><p><strong>Jimmy Kimmel</strong> spoofed his own dramatic weight reduction in a series of parody videos touting the "Jimmy K Diet Plan," but in reality, the Jimmy Kimmel Live! host, 45, credits the advice of&nbsp;<strong>Dr. Oz</strong> for his transformation. "It’s a ridiculous thing, but the way I feel is: I’m on television, so I need a television doctor to tell me. I can’t go to a regular doctor," Kimmel <a href=#>joked</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.3983739837398><h2>John Goodman</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/john_goodman.jpg><p>Roseanne star and Coen&nbsp;brothers regular <strong>John Goodman</strong> says the moment he realized he had to lose weight was when he starred in 2006 TV movie The Year Without a Santa Claus. "I looked at it and I was really unhappy about the way I looked," Goodman, 61, <a href=#>told</a> Men's Health. Working with a New Orleans fitness guru named <strong>Mackie Shilstone</strong>, Goodman dropped 70 pounds. He struggled to keep the weight off, however, and <a href=#>a recent profile</a> with RadioTimes says "he looks dangerously obese."</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3.467365967366><h2>Jonah Hill</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/jonah_hill.jpg><p><strong>Jonah Hill</strong>, 29, dropped 40 pounds after 2011's Moneyball, the film that saw him nominated for an Oscar. The secret? "It was just mostly diet," he <a href=#>told</a> ABC's&nbsp;Nightline&nbsp;in 2012. "I wish there was some crazy thing that I did, like a pill or a genie or something. But it was, unfortunately, I went to see a nutritionist, and he told me what to eat to change my habits and stuff."

"But he did weigh 205 pounds."&nbsp;Trainer <strong>Bobby Strom</strong>&nbsp;stepped in for the fix: "A year and a half ago," says Strom, "<strong>Ryan Reynolds</strong>, who I've worked with for nine years, did an episode of Family Guy. When Seth saw him, he said, 'Hey, man, who's your trainer?' Now Seth weighs 170, works out seven days a week and eats things like egg whites and Greek yogurt."</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.4848484848485><h2>Seth Rogen</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/seth_rogen.jpg><p>This Is the End star <strong>Seth Rogen</strong> went from chubby to trim, losing 30 pounds over a nine-month period leading up to the 2009 filming of&nbsp;The Green Hornet. He's since added much of that back. "I'm slowly outgrowing all the clothes I bought last year," the 31-year-old actor <a href=#>said </a>in 2011. "It's a sad thing.
