Director Matt Reeves previously teased the scene, promising we'd see it eventually. And luckily, we didn't have to wait long. We even got two versions, the full scene and the full scene with director's commentary.<h2>Who is going to be The Joker in the new Batman movie?</h2>The Joker character is almost always a safe bet in live action films,'The Batman' introduced the character in one of the final scenes of the movie but it was only a few moments alongside Paul Dano's 'Riddler' character.<h2>Who is the new Batman 2022 cast?</h2>It stars Robert Pattinson as Bruce Wayne / Batman alongside Zoë Kravitz, Paul Dano, Jeffrey Wright, John Turturro, Peter Sarsgaard, Andy Serkis, and Colin Farrell.<h2>Who are the twins in Batman 2022?</h2>Fans Shocked To Realise Why They Recognise Bouncer Twins In The Batman. Filmgoers have taken to Reddit to share their surprise at recognising the bouncer twins in The Batman. Credited as 'The Twins', real-life twins Max and Charlie Carver previously played Preston and Porter Scavo on Desperate Housewives.<h2>THE BATMAN (2022) Joker Explained | Matt Reeves, Robert Pattinson Movie | Barry Keoghan As Joker</h2><p></p><h2>Who was Ben Affleck in The Batman 2022?</h2>Robert Pattinson, Ben Affleck, and Michael Keaton, will all play Batman in 2022. The trio will suit up as the Caped Crusader in two DC Universe blockbusters – The Batman and The Flash.<h2>Will there be a Joker 2?</h2>'Joker 2': Todd Phillips Confirms 'Joker' Sequel Is On the Way, Reveals Title. Joaquin Phoenix is returning for the sequel. Image via Warner Bros. Over a year after rumors began floating around that Todd Phillips' Joker would receive a sequel, Phillips has officially confirmed the news.<h2>Who was the best Joker?</h2>Heath Ledger (The Dark Knight)<p>Not only has he become the definitive Joker – compared endlessly to new and old actors alike – but Ledger has more iconic scenes in The Dark Knight (opens in new tab) than most actors do in a career.</p><h2>Why does the Joker cut his face off?</h2>Origins. When the Joker became obsessing over destroying the Bat-Family, he decided to arrange for his face to be surgically removed. According to the Joker, he did this to symbolize how even without his, "Mask" he was still the joker where-as Batman's Robins and Bat-Girls' identities were only mask-deep.<h2>Why does Barry Keoghan's Joker look like that?</h2>According to director Matt Reeves, he was born that way. "It's like Phantom of the Opera," Reeves explained to Variety. "He has a congenital disease where he can't stop smiling and it's horrific. His face is half-covered through most of the film." This adds a new dimension to the character of The Joker.<h2>What is the Joker's real name?</h2>Jack Napier, also known as the Joker, is a fictional character introduced in the 1989 superhero film Batman, directed by Tim Burton. Primarily portrayed by Jack Nicholson, the character was based on the iconic supervillain the Joker.<h2>What is Joker's secret identity?</h2>He also revealed his real name: Jack Napier. Napier spent all of his efforts revealing how Batman's false heroics actually only lead to greater corruption in Gotham City. He worked diligently to save Gotham from its turmoil until the effects of the pills finally wore off, and he became The Joker once again.<h2>How old is the Joker?</h2>In Joker, Phoenix's character is about 30 years old. In the film, we watch as he interacts with a young Bruce Wayne of about nine or 10 years old.<h2>Did Johnny Depp play the Joker?</h2>Even though Joker takes place in a different universe than The Batman, a Johnny Depp Joker seems like one Joker too many. But arguably the most important reason why Johnny Depp being cast as the Joker would be a stretch is that Warner Bros. just fired him, paying him $10 million for shooting one scene.<h2>Who is the most popular Batman?</h2>Of course, many aficionados insist that Kevin Conroy, the vocal-talent star of several animated TV series and made-for-video films, is the all-time best Batman.<h2>Is the Joker Bruce Wayne's brother?</h2>That's right: Batman and Joker are half-brothers, at least according to Penny. The movie never explicitly makes clear whether that's true or not. Arthur, donning a red clown nose, pays a visit to Wayne Manor and performs an impromptu magic show for an enthralled young Bruce Wayne (played by Dante Pereira-Olson).<h2>Who is the villain in the new Batman?</h2>We are introduced to Colin Farrell's Oswald Cobblepot / The Penguin, John Turturro's Carmine Falcone and other assorted baddies, but it was Edward Nashton, a.k.a. The Riddler, as played by Paul Dano, who nabbed the top spot as THE BATMAN's primary villain.<h2>Did Pattinson quit Batman?</h2>Robert Pattinson Exits 'The Batman' Franchise, Ben Affleck Back On Board. Batfleck is due to get a long-awaited sidekick... Robert Pattinson is reportedly stepping down from the role of the Caped Crusader following his appearance in The Batman, with Ben Affleck getting ready to don the cape and cowl once more.<h2>Why did Pattinson leave Batman?</h2>Reportedly, the reason behind the clash is Reeves' inclination towards perfectionism, which seemingly bothered Pattinson, and this led to their relationship turning sour.<h2>How much is Robert Pattinson getting paid for The Batman?</h2>There's a reason why Robert Pattison received a low salary of “only” $3 million for his titular role in The Batman. Following the reveal of Hollywood's highest-paid movie stars of 2021, some were surprised to learn Pattinson rounded out the bottom of the list.<h2>Is Joker older than Bruce Wayne?</h2>The Joker was initially depicted as being much older than Batman. However, The Killing Joke presented his origin as a young comedian with a pregnant wife, and he was about 25 in it. This was nine years before the common DC canon, making him 34 now, so maybe the Joker is the same age as Batman.<h2>Why is Joker so crazy?</h2>The heist goes awry; the comedian leaps into a chemical vat to escape Batman, surfacing disfigured. This, combined with the earlier accidental death of his wife and unborn child, drives the comedian insane, turning him into the Joker.<h2>Will Joaquin Phoenix play The Joker in The Batman?</h2>It is very unlikely that Joaquin Phoenix will appear in a sequel to The Batman, given the amount of hype around Barry Keoghan's version of the character.<h2>Is Joe Chill the Joker?</h2>In the final version of the film, however, Jack Napier (who would later become the Joker) is Thomas and Martha's killer. According to producer Michael Uslan, Chill is one of Napier's minions who accompanied him in mugging the Waynes and was credited as "Other Mugger" (portrayed by Clyde Gatell).<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye9ahpmaho2K9ra3YoqWgZZqkuKa%2BjKKlZqyYmnqjrdOmmKdlYmV%2Fcw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-is-the-setting-of-the-story-the-treasure-of-lemon-brown.html><span>←</span><span>What is the setting of the story The Treasure of Lemon Brown?</span></a>
