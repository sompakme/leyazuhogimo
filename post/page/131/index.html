<a href=../../../texas-judge-edgar-allen-amos-accused-of-calling-immigrants-wetbacks.html></a>
A Texas judge who came out of retirement to take part in the state’s controversial police and military crackdown on undocumented immigrants was reported last week to an ethics panel for allegedly complaining to lawyers about “wetbacks.”
The Daily Beast has obtained a copy of the formal accusation, which is laid out in a sworn complaint that was submitted to the state’s Commission on Judicial Conduct.
Judge Edgar Allen Amos now faces a potential ethics probe, which if substantiated, would call into question every ruling he’s made in local Texas courts.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>The Ideal Body Skincare Routine, According to Dermatologists</h2><time>Jul 6, 2024</time>

I'm in trouble I'm an addict
I'm addicted to this girl
She's got my heart tied in a knot
And my stomach in a whirl
But even worse I can't stop calling her
She's all I want and more

I swear she's going mad
And that cellular-er will be the death to us</article><article class=post-entry><h2>60 Best Beach Songs for Summer 2023 | Best Beach Music</h2><time>Jul 5, 2024</time>
