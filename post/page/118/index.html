All day I've faced the barren waste,
Without the taste of water:
Cool water. (Water.)
Old Dan and I, with throats burned dry,
An' souls that cry for water: (Water.)
Cool, (Water.)
Clear, (Water.)
Water. (Water.)Keep a-movin, Dan,
Don't you listen to him, Dan,
He's the devil, not a man:
Spreads the burning sand with water. (Water.)
Dan, can you see that big, green tree, (Water.)

<a href=../../../has-non-alcoholic-wine-finally-got-good.html></a>

Sobriety is no longer solely the preserve of smug Instagram wellness gurus either; style and cultural arbiters such as Kate Moss, Naomi Campbell and Kendrick Lamar have all ditched the booze. Inebriation has never been chic, but a rise in stylish non-alcoholic bars and drinking options means sacrificing the hard stuff doesn’t necessarily mean sacrificing fun.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>How do you reset a Maytag Neptune washer?</h2><time>Jul 14, 2024</time>
<a href=../../../how-do-you-reset-a-maytag-neptune-washer.html></a>
Answer
Reset the Sequence on a Maytag MAH5500BWW Washing Machine
Locate the “Off” button, which is to the right of the Neptune’s “Start/Pause” button on the Neptune’s control panel.
If you press the “Off” button during the first 30-seconds of the cycle starting, the current cycle will be terminated.
If you push the “Off” button while there is still water in the tub, the washing machine will drain automatically.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../../post/page/117/>← Prev Page</a>
