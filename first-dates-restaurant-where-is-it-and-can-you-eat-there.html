Let's face it, we'd love to pop down to the restaurant (yes, it's real!) to get a taste of the experience without the awkward encounter that's televised to the nation. If you want to know a little more about how to get there, what's on the menu and how much the bill will set you back then we've got you covered. But we do warn you, there's no sign of Maître d' Fred, bartender Merlin or waiter Sam when the cameras stop rolling.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/95ed7bbbee5b-firstdates-z.jpg><h2 dir=ltr>Where is the restaurant?</h2><p id=ex7VuT2exD3A data-wc=91>Situated in Bank, the restaurant responsible for (hopefully) pairing off singletons is indeed a real, functioning restaurant. Located at 1 Warwick Court, Paternoster Square, it's next door to St Paul’s Cathedral and therefore a prime location for tourists who might be wanting to visit one of the city's oldest Holy buildings or the likes of the nearby Tate Modern. For those less interested in exploring the city and more intrigued by taking a foodie trip to the capital, the nearest tube stop to the famous restaurant is St. Paul's.&nbsp;</p><h2 dir=ltr>Is the restaurant open to the public?</h2><p id=eHuL64c8MV7z data-wc=43>Good news! Members of the public can dine at the restaurant when filming is not taking place. While you can't get your claim to fame by waving in the background of one of the episodes, you can try out the food for yourself.&nbsp;</p><p id=e3ul4eOOfZho data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Where is the First Dates Hotel filmed?&nbsp;</a></strong></p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<h2><span style=background-color:initial>What's on the restaurant's menu?</span></h2><p id=eXKtxcveKCql data-wc=22>In terms of the menu, it's full of reasonably-priced classic British options like steak tartare, beer-battered cod and rhubarb and apple crumble.</p><p id=ega1dihuQanw data-wc=112>For starters, the likes of parsnip soup will set you back £7 while the pork pie served with a dollop of piccalilli is priced at £11. Some of the main dishes you can feast on include a classic burger served with cheese, bacon, pickle and onion rings for £18 and the £28 lamb shank served with parsnip mash and buttered beans. The good news for vegetarian or vegan fans of the show, despite it being a chop house, there are two suitable options: carrots, lentils and onions served with butterbean hummus and almond dressing which costs £18 or herb dumplings served with spiced squash wild mushroom and fresh cheese which is £20.</p><p id=eai8EgXWS-de data-wc=23>And the salted caramel brownie with ice cream and the dark chocolate fondant are sure to satisfy anyone with a sweet tooth.
