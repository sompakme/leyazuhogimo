The actor was twice nominated for an Emmy for his portrayal of an action hero who struggles to uphold his family’s noble values in a brutal world.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>In <i>Thrones</i>’ eighth and final season, Jon Snow discovered his true name was Aegon Targaryen, a potential heir to the Iron Throne. In the series finale, he was exiled from Westeros and journeyed North of the Wall with the Wildlings to leave his old life behind.&nbsp;</span></p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class=p1><span class=s1>Since completing his work across eight seasons of <i>Thrones</i>, Harington has appeared in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, co-starring in 2021’s <i>Eternals</i>. He also recently starred in the title role in the National Theater’s live production of <i>Henry V</i>. On Thrones, the actor was known for enduring some of the show’s most grueling filming, including the final season’s infamous 11 weeks of winter night shoots in Northern Ireland.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>The development signals an intriguing new direction in HBO’s handling of author George R.R. Martin’s fantasy universe, a move not unlike Disney+’s management of its Star Wars and Marvel brands where the streamer has found success launching character-focused sequel series such as <i>WandaVision</i> (starring Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda Maximoff) and <i>Obi-Wan Kenobi</i> (with Ewan McGregor reprising his iconic role).</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Perhaps most boldly from a creative standpoint, the project would upend <i>Thrones</i>’ final season as the last word on the fates of the surviving characters in HBO’s most popular and Emmy-winning series of all time. In theory, the project could open the door for other surviving characters from the<i> Thrones</i> universe to reappear — such as Arya Stark (Maisie Williams), Sansa Stark (Sophie Turner) and Brienne of Tarth (Gwendoline Christie).</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>This development news means there are now seven <i>Thrones</i> projects in the works in addition to the upcoming <i>House of the Dragon</i> prequel series, which debuts Aug. 21. <i>Dragon</i> tells the story of a civil war within House Targaryen and is set about 200 years before the events in <i>Thrones</i>.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>HBO’s other live-action prequels in various stages of development are <i>10,000 Ships</i> (aka <i>Nymeria</i>) with showrunner Amanda Segel, <i>9 Voyages</i> (aka <i>The Sea Snake</i>) with showrunner Bruno Heller, and <i>Dunk and Egg </i>with showrunner Steve Conrad.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>There are also three animated prequel projects, <a href=#>first reported by THR</a>, including <i>The Golden Empire</i>, which is set in the China-inspired land of Yi Ti.</span></p><p>In addition, there’s a GoT stage play in development that would revive iconic characters and explore the origins of Robert’s Rebellion, which THR <a href=#>first reported in March</a>.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>HBO and Harington’s representatives had no comment.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue9OvZq2uXaOyuL%2BOoJimnV2ks27Ax6ump52jYrewuoyspaivXai9qrrOn51maWJognKClm1obmc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./cooper-rush-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Cooper Rush Net Worth</span></a>
