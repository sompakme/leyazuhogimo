The store’s owner, Laura Ann Carleton, was declared deceased by the <strong>San Bernardino Sheriff’s</strong> Department, according to a news release. The identity of the suspect, who fled the scene, has not been disclosed.</p><p>Following a thorough investigation, detectives discovered that the suspect had made derogatory comments about a rainbow flag that was situated outside the store before proceeding to shoot Carleton, as detailed in the news release.</p><p>When confronted by deputies, the suspect was armed and subsequently met with lethal force, resulting in their own demise. The sheriff’s department has ongoing investigations.</p><p>The website for the Mag Pi store described <strong>Laura Ann Carleton</strong> as a mother of nine who had been married for <strong>28 years</strong>. Operating under the name Lauri, Carleton had a background in fashion, including a 15-year tenure as an executive at Kenneth Cole, having studied at the Art Center School of Design.</p><p>In response to the tragedy, <strong>Mountain Provisions Cooperative</strong>, a local grocery store, acknowledged Carleton’s instrumental role in organizing a free store following a recent blizzard. A post on social media commemorated her as an unshakable advocate for equality, love, and justice, urging individuals to raise flags in her memory.</p><p>Although Carleton did not identify as a member of the <strong>LGBTQ+</strong> community, the Lake Arrowhead LGBTQ+ group highlighted her commitment to fostering a safe environment within her shop for everyone. Carleton’s untimely passing due to an unjust act of violence left the community deeply saddened, with heartfelt condolences pouring in on the organization’s social media platforms. Many acknowledged the significance of the Pride flag at Mag Pi, which had played a role in making them feel welcome and secure within the area.</p><p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p><ul><li><a href=#>The 10 Most Worst Cities in New York: A List of High-Crime Areas</a></li><li><a href=#>The 10 Most Worst Cities in Florida: A List of High-Crime Areas</a></li><li><a href=#>Exploring the Allure of Townhomes for Rent in Los Angeles: A Comprehensive Guide</a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s63LpaqhnV6YvK57wpqjop6fp7uqrYysq6iqlWK8uLrEq2Smp6SdsrN5zp9kcmWWlsGiuMuyZKygn6l6sMLEq2SaZaCntqWxjJ%2Bjmp9dmba0vMuasJ6cXZ67brTEq2SsoJ%2BlfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./exclusive-ryan-reynolds-wants-taika-waititi-s-korg-in-deadpool-3.html><span>←</span><span>Exclusive: Ryan Reynolds Wants Taika Waititis Korg In Deadpool 3</span></a>
