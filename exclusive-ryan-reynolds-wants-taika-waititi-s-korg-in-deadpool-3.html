He got big actors on board. The star was even one of the three co-writers on the script. One of the highlights of the much-anticipated Deadpool 3 will inevitably be learning what new ideas he has in store for audiences, especially with the movie officially becoming part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. While the third movie is still a ways off, one of our <a href=#>trusted and proven</a> inside sources now has information on one piece to the Deadpool 3 puzzle.</p><p>Ryan Reynolds currently wants to get Taika Waititi’s Korg in the movie. We weren’t able to learn how far along Reynolds is with this idea, so we don’t know if he’s talked to the studio or Taika Waititi about it yet. However, the star has a history of making things happen for the Deadpool movies, so it isn’t hard to believe that he’ll make this plan happen. It would be interesting to know what brought about this idea for the actor. Is this because Ryan Reynolds wants to work with Taika Waititi again? The pair just worked on the movie Free Guy, as their new <a href=#>trailer reaction</a> video shows. Others who’ve worked with Taika Waititi in the past have made it sound like he is pleasant to work with. It’s reasonable to believe that Reynolds is seeing the opportunity and taking it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/korg-900x510.jpg><p>It’s also fair to believe that while working on the video where they promoted Free Guy, or while on the set of Free Guy together, Ryan Reynolds simply thought of a very good joke he can’t let go of. It would be safe to expect that if <a href=#>Korg</a> shows up in <a href=#>Deadpool 3</a>, he’ll be in a couple of scenes as a small player, not a main character. While Wendy Molyneux and Lizzie Molyneux-Logelin have been hired to write Deadpool 3, Reynolds himself worked with two co-writers on Deadpool 2. He is no stranger to coming up with ideas and going for them.</p><p>This was especially true for getting actors to come on for cameos. In Deadpool 2, we saw scenes with Matt <a href=#>Damon</a> and Brad <a href=#>Pitt</a>. Both of those actors came to be in the <a href=#>Marvel movie</a> after Ryan Reynolds wrote to them, explaining the idea for their scenes, why it was funny, and then asking them to be part of the film. The actor didn’t know these two. Getting Taika Waititi on board, who he actually knows and has worked with, may be a much simpler get, even if Waititi is fairly busy as a director and actor.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ryan-reynolds-6-underground-1-900x473.png><p>Of course, the bigger obstacle may not be getting Taika Waititi on board for the idea so much as asking Marvel themselves if he can use the character of Korg. Using Korg isn’t the same as using a character like Thor, which is tied into many of Marvel’s storylines throughout its cinematic universe. Still, Marvel has many storylines and has to be particular about how characters are used. It makes sense that to make this happen, Ryan Reynolds will have to be talking to the higher-ups at Marvel studios and get a Korg appearance approved by multiple gatekeepers before it can happen.</p><p>Still, Ryan Reynolds seems to have his ways. He’s the star of R-Rated movies that are officially becoming an accepted part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. He’s talked major stars into small appearances in his films. If Reynolds wants Korg to appear in Deadpool 3, it seems reasonable to believe that’s going to happen.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2idqJi5tr%2FIr5xmqqmWu26%2BxLKlqKSUqHqsu9GgZaGsnaE%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./chelsea-handler-frees-her-nipples-on-a-snowy-mountaintop-photos.html><span>←</span><span>Chelsea Handler frees her nipples on a snowy mountaintop (PHOTOS)</span></a>
