It’s a warmth that goes all the way back to fun family summers at Balmoral, Christmases at <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/sandringham-house/>Sandringham</a>—and now finds expression in the very modern medium of shared family WhatsApp groups.” The garden party provided “the much-needed vitality that the younger generation brings” to the monarchy, English wrote.</p><p>Even before Tuesday’s garden party, <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/royals/princess-beatrice-stepping-up-royal-duties/><u>buzz had been swirling around Beatrice</u></a> in particular, with the possibility being spoken of that she could, at least temporarily, <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/royals/princess-beatrice-princess-eugenie-future-as-woking-royals/><u>take on working royal duties</u></a> in light of the odd year that has been 2024 in the royal family. All four cousins have children and careers outside of the royal family; for Peter and Zara, working for the Firm has never been an option, as their mother, Anne, chose to not accept titles for them—a move that Zara has applauded. “The Phillips children were always destined to grow up away from the main royal spotlight, perhaps fortunately so,” English wrote. As such, they’ll never be working royals.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fvcUR6DzTXeGwnTwFSBf7g-1920-80.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8pqrCyeRvyKgTmGRMp9oY6-1920-80.jpg><p>But what of Beatrice and Eugenie? “The unfortunate truth, however, is that none of them will be asked to support the working royals on a more permanent basis, however badly they are needed,” English continued. “And for that they must thank the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7eV9xcEbG4CSa9jDTCvDrB-1920-80.jpg><p>When <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/prince-harry/>Prince Harry</a> and Meghan Markle stepped back as working members of the royal family in January 2020, they wanted to take part in a part-time royal setup, but the late Queen Elizabeth turned them down “very firmly,” English wrote, and they were told “that their preferred option of being ‘half-in, half-out’ royals while pursuing lucrative commercial careers was simply unacceptable.” She added “Seeking commercial deals while acting on behalf of, or representing, the British head of state would also have been a clear conflict of interest, and Her Majesty knew that all too well.” As such, “here is the consequence: there can be no relaxation of the rules for any of the younger royals,” English wrote. “It is full time or nothing. The occasional garden party aside, more substantial roles for William’s cousins are out of the question—for now, at least.”</p><p>Beatrice and Eugenie both have full-time jobs of their own—Beatrice is Vice President of Strategic Partnerships at the U.S. tech company Afiniti, while Eugenie is a director at an art gallery, Hauser & Wirth, in London.</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.
