One of the most popular names thrown out there is Nia Long, but the list goes beyond that. <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>J. Cole</a> famously did it on one of his songs from his 2013 project, Born Sinner. The introduction to the album, "Villuminati," is a grand and epic opener to the record. However, there is one bar that has now become a full-circle moment for the German-born rapper. <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Cole raps</a> in the first verse, "Boy Meets World, I'm tryna find a new Topanga / And bang her out, no hanging out."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Here, he raps about having a crush on Boy Meets World star Danielle "Topanga" Fisher. She was one of the lead actors in that popular 90s sitcom and many have touted her as being a childhood dream girl. Well, luckily <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">for Cole</a>, he finally got the chance to meet the actress. The North Carolina-raised artist performed at the iHeartRadio Music Festival this past weekend. He and <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Lil Durk</a> both rocked the stage to play the smash collab hit, "All My Life." After that, he went backstage and someone was dying to meet him.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-danielle-fishel-cannot-contain-her-excitement-for-j-cole-backstage-watch>Danielle Fishel Cannot Contain Her Excitement For J. Cole Backstage: Watch</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In the video clip above you can see how ecstatic the 42-year-old Fishel was to meet J. Cole. The wholesome reaction from her makes it all the more endearing, "It&nbsp;is&nbsp;J. Cole!," she said with glee. When he approached her, she said, "I have to say hi to you. I went and saw your show in L.A. Unbelievable! I’m such a big fan." Both of them gave each other a hug as Cole expressed his appreciation. "Me too, likewise. Good to see you." Fishel's face lit up and it made for a cute moment that.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">What are your initial thoughts on J.
