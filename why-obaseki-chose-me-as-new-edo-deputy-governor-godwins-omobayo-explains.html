This was the million-naira question l asked His Excellency, Governor Godwin Obaseki when he gave me the surprise invitation for dialogue about this job a couple of days ago.“His answer was simple and direct: ‘God!’ He elaborated further: ‘I looked through my history books and discovered that Akoko-Edo has never served in this capacity. I talked to a few key leaders from Akoko-Edo, across party lines, and all fingers pointed at you. The ultimate decision, however, came from God, and l could not say no.”<h2>Why I accepted to be Obaseki’s deputy governor</h2><p class=align-left>He further explained that he accepted the offer to serve as <a href=#>Edo state</a> deputy governor because of his <a href=#>people</a> and the fact that God had decided to show him mercy and lift him.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/ea4fe4ed7a7def25.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Emefiele in trouble as dispatch rider tells court how he collected dollars in cash for ex-CBN gov</span></p></a>"First, my people of Akoko-Edo would never have forgiven me, if l had messed up the only chance God, history and ripe time has given them since creation.“Second, my mind went straight to the book of Romans in the Bible. In Chapter 9, Verses 15 and 16, God said to Moses: ‘I will show mercy to anyone l choose, and l will show compassion to anyone l choose.’ So, it is God who decides to show mercy and uplift one. We can neither choose it nor work for it."<h2>Omobayo sworn In as Edo deputy governor</h2><p class=align-left><strong>Legit.ng</strong> earlier reported that a few hours after the impeachment of Philip Shaibu, Omobayo was on Monday, April 8, sworn in as <a href=#>Edo deputy governor.</a></p><p class=align-left>Justice Daniel Okungbowa, the Edo state chief judge, administered the oath of office on Godwins around 1:40 pm.</p><p class=align-left>After he took the oath of office, an excited Omobayo was greeted by a rousing crowd in one of the halls at the government house.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkvbC4yK2gnKtfZoJ5g49vbGavmK56sK7ArJykoV2YtbC%2FxGacnaddmbKxwdOyZKCnppq%2Fr7vRZp6onKeeu7R5zqamm5mppHqmxM%2BlmKKmo2Q%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-to-expect-from-the-coronation-dress-code-according-to-royal-experts.html><span>←</span><span>What to Expect From the Coronation Dress Code, According to Royal Experts</span></a>
