The reality TV star has established firm boundaries for device use within her family—no screens in the morning, during meals, or in the car—ensuring her children engage more with the world around them rather than just digital content.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/9e9cc6349c62-happy-easter-kim-north-890632708.jpg><p id=ek8rOOgWBHw data-wc=48>Kim’s family-centric approach also reflects in her personal life decisions. After her relationship with rapper Kanye West, with whom she shares North, Chicago, six, Saint, eight, and Psalm, four, ended in 2022, Kim has shifted her focus more towards personal happiness and fulfillment rather than seeking a relationship.&nbsp;</p><p id=eC9u-aRCDEa data-wc=33>“For so long, I did what made other people happy, and I think in the last two years I decided, I’m going to make myself happy,” she revealed in a recent Vogue interview.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/15359d7ae065-7341982432746360095-copy-url-1-webapp-884201496.jpg><p id=e02l_ZYRHt5 data-wc=36>Adding to the family’s creative legacy, North recently took to the stage at the Footprint Center in Phoenix, Arizona, during one of her father’s concerts to announce her debut album, humorously titled Elementary School Drop Out.&nbsp;</p><p id=ec3KmdOlL_T data-wc=37>The title is a playful homage to her father’s debut, The College Dropout, although it has stirred some controversy.
