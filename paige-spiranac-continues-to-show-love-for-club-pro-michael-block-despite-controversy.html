Following a slew of interviews over the past week, the club pro appeared on the Ripper Magoo podcast with sensationalist host <strong>Bob Menery</strong> and compared himself to <strong>Rory McIlroy</strong> in an overly-confident manner.</p><figure class="ue-c-article__media ue-c-article__media--video ue-c-article--media-icon-m-from-tablet" readability=1><p><span class=ue-c-article__media-description>Paige Spiranac invites fans to 'play a hole' with her: "It's so much fun"</span></p></figure><p>"He's a lot longer than I am," Block said. "What I would shoot from where Rory hits it would be stupid. I think I'd be one of the best players in the world. Hands down. If I had that stupid length, all day. My iron game, wedge game, around the greens, and my putting is world-class."</p><p>Block received a sponsor's exemption to the <strong>Charles Schwab Challenge</strong> and did not make the cut Friday, finishing in last place with a total of 15 over par.</p><p>Critics had a field day with his poor performance, especially considering the comments he made earlier, but Spiranac defended Block.</p><h2 class=ue-c-article__subheadline>Paige Spiranac defends Michael Block</h2><p>Spiranac, 30, took to Twitter to defend Block and tell fans to "cut him some slack." She even pointed out in a follow-up comment that most people probably only saw the short clip, not the entire podcast.</p><p>"Feel for Michael Block after his round today," Spiranac tweeted. "There's so much pressure to perform and no one prepares you for how to handle public scrutiny. One quick video clip or headline can twist the narrative (I know from experience...most recently involving him) so cut him some slack."</p><p>Earlier this week, Spiranac praised Block for his PGA Championship performance, saying he is her new favorite golfer.</p><p>She continues to be an important voice for the club pro, who also had something to say to his "haters."</p><h2 class=ue-c-article__subheadline>Michael Block lashes out at 'haters'</h2><p>Block finished 15th at a major tournament, an incredible feat even for a seasoned professional, but even he feels it was a fluke.</p><p>"Whose ever taken out of context the fact that I could be the best player in the world or all that if I could hit it as far as Rory, I mean the fact is, yeah, if I was 60 to 70 to 80 yards longer off the tee, yeah, of course I could compete on the PGA Tour," Block said. "I mean, come on. I'm not, I'm 46, I'm a club pro.</p><p>"These guys bomb it past me, and it's cool. I've got no problem with it. Am I going to be the best player in the world or the top 20 in the world? No, I'm not. I'm still going to be a club pro at the end of the day. I'm not going to be on tour and all that stuff."</p><p>Block was incredibly humble after finishing 15th at the PGA Championship and days later claimed he'd be one of the best in the world with a little more length. He did <a href=#>dunk a hole-in-one</a>, though, so maybe just let him cook.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RnJhnm5%2BifKa6jqCmpZ5fZ31zf45pbGhqZ2SDdYOQa3CdbGRrfnd%2FxXJvbmtol4F2sZVnn62lnA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./molly-martuza-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html><span>←</span><span>Molly Martuza Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</span></a>
