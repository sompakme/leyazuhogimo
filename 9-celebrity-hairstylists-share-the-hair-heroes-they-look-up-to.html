Johnson," Nelms shares with InStyle. "[One day] she had given herself a very professional looking hairstyle that was so beautifully done. I thought she had gone to a hair salon. I was obsessed with it and questioned her all day for details so that I could do it on myself."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Although creating a bomb style at home may not seem like a huge feat for some, for Nelms, it gave her the push she needed to recognize that her wildest dreams could come true.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Realizing that a regular person could create such a professional look helped me to see myself as possibly being a hairstylist at a very young age," the pro stylist says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And now that's she's got her skills down pat, the only thing Nelms needs when she's working are the right hair tools to bring her creative visions to life. "I work with so many different hair textures," she explains. "It's important to have great tools like Goody Hair to help me create and execute every style I'm inspired to create."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-mona-everett></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Monaé Everett</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-low-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Growing up I had so many hair heroes, there were so many women, from Tracee Ellis Ross to Aaliyah to Monica," celebrity hairstylist and the creator of The Monae Life Academy for hairstylists <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Monae Everett</a> shares. "But the woman who had the biggest impact on my life was <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Tina Campbell</a> of gospel duo Mary Mary. I loved her different bright hues of red and various creative hairstyles with her natural hair."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Everett's first memory of Campbell's hair was when the video for the hit song <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>"Shackles"</a> premiered.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Tina's beautiful red hair was in a short, natural style and I had not seen very many women rocking their natural, non-relaxed, hair before this time," the hairstylist remembers. "Since Tina, a gospel singer, colored her hair red, I was able to show my mother her coif and convince her to allow me to color my hair red, too. I have not had my natural hair color since that day when I was 14-years-old."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dyeing her own hair Tina Campbell-red piqued Everett's curiosity in hairstyling, which eventually blossomed into a full-blown career. But while she was mesmerized by color, the hair expert's ultimate goal was to never compromise the hair in the process.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I enrolled in cosmetology school my senior year of high school after this," Everett shares. "My focus is and has always been how to create beautiful looks and keep the hair healthy."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-chuck-amos></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Chuck Amos</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"When I was a teenager, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Janet Zeitoun</a> was my very first hair hero," says Ouidad brand ambassador Chuck Amos, who is currently working with the brand for its <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Coil Infusion line</a>, made specifically for 4A to 4C curls. "She was Janet Jackson's hairstylist, like forever. When I first saw Janet's hair on Soul Train, performing <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>"What Have You Done For Me Lately"</a> during the summer of '86, I was blown outta my mind. I thought it was Janet's real hair! It was big, soft, and moving around effortlessly and her curls were light and floaty. It was impeccable. I recorded it on VHS and replayed it all the time."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While wigs and weaves have come a long way, and most can barely tell when a celebrity is wearing extensions today, Amos remembers a time when they were stiff, clumped, and the texture didn't mimic that of natural hair, which made Zeitoun's work all the more impressive.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"During the release of her last single and music video on the "Control" album, Janet Zeitoun took Janet Jackson's signature curly hair weave and straightened it [for "The Pleasure Principle"], causing a world frenzy," Amos recalls. "My mom and I called her salon at that moment and were told that Zeitoun had ironed Janet's weave with an actual clothing iron, like in the '60s. In 1987, there were only 'curly' weaves on the market but after that video, straight textured hair became the new beauty-store demand."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The stylist later learned that Zeitoun used an interlock technique, otherwise known as French lace, where small hair plugs were tied at the roots to create a flowy finish that wasn't really seen before in the Black community.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"You have no idea how excited I was to do hair extensions and weaves back then, I was only 14-years-old and we started buying hair and doing my cousins', aunties', and my mom's hair that way," he exclaims. "It was a magical time for me. I was so young and super inspired. I wanted to be a hairstylist immediately!"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And even to this day, it's Zeitoun's work that keeps Amos inspired.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Her craft with Janet Jackson's hair influenced me to make Black women feel the 'lightness' and 'flow' of their natural hair to inspire them like I was inspired during the '80s," he shares. "Those images were what made my career so enriched — giving me a name in this industry, and I never looked back."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_53-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: Janet Jackson's Red Carpet Evolution</strong></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-charlotte-mensah></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_57-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Charlotte Mensah</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_58-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Instagram/@charlottemensah</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_59-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Much like the other stylists, iconic celebrity hair expert Charlotte Mensah's hair hero is someone who motivated her to reach new heights during her early days in the biz.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_61-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"My hair hero has to be the late Winston Isaacs, he was the founder of the first Black salon to open in the U.K." she shares with InStyle. "I worked under him in the late '80s, early '90s at a salon in Mayfair called Splinters. It was quite literally the 'mecca for black hair,' housing stars from this side and the other side of the world, an example being Diana Ross. He invested a lot of time and effort into me at the beginning of my career, helping me to not only hone my craft, but also instilled a dedication to discipline and doing things the right way. He was also an amazing stylist. I have nothing but admiration, respect, and love for him."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_63-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Mensah shares that on top of styling techniques, Isaacs taught her the importance of being punctual at all times, and even advised her to avoid chewing gum while working on clients.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_65-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Definitely something I've taken with me and educate my own staff about these things," she shares. "I always get a sense of deja vu when I think about chewing gum."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_67-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Beyond Isaacs' hard, but fair and helpful rules, Mensah also credits him with helping her to realize that not even the sky was the limit when it came to her career as a hairstylist, and now haircare brand founder.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_69-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"In many ways, entering Splinters was the first day of the rest of my life," Mensah says. "I got to see Black excellence live in the flesh; in hair, in customers, in colleagues, and of course, customer service. The experience has become part of my DNA, it built and shaped everything you see me do today. My experience with Winston also made me want to align myself with people and brands that uplift and elevate the Black community, hence me partnering with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Thirteen Lune</a> as my U.S. based retailer."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_71-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Now, Mensah gets to pass the torch, and act as a hair hero to others, with her signature products, such as the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Manketti Oil Shampoo</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Conditioner</a>, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nofollow>Pomade</a> now being more widely available.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_73-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I am thrilled [about] our inclusion of Charlotte Mensah on Thirteen Lune," says co-founder Nyakio Grieco. "In addition to this collection being a staple in my personal hair care regimen, I am excited to share this product with the world. Catering and uplifting Black beauty founders has always been a goal with Thirteen Lune. Being able to showcase this U.K. brand stateside has been a teller of why the site is necessary for the overall beauty community."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-annagjid-kee-taylor></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_75-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Annagjid "Kee" Taylor</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_76-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_77-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Hairstylist Annagjid "Kee" Taylor may have worked with major stars like Tiffany Haddish and Keke Palmer, but she'll never forget who gave her her first shot.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_79-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Chuck Amos</a> was the first person who gave me a chance in the industry with my first paid gig," she remembers. "I assisted him on a photoshoot in New York for celebrity party planner <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Colin Cowie</a>. It was our first time ever meeting and he was so inviting and amazing. We spent so much time together that day I felt like it was divine intervention, definitely meant to be."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_81-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">From that meeting, Taylor says Amos taught her how to style a variety of hair types (which isn't a part of the regular curriculum at most cosmetology schools) and learned how to switch up her technique for editorial shoots.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_83-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"[These are] tricks I didn't know coming from being behind the chair in a salon for five years," she shares. "With me having the dream of becoming a celebrity stylist, learning that from him meant a lot to me and I still use those tricks to this day."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_85-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Aside from that, Amos also encouraged Taylor to let go of others' judgement, and trust her creative instinct.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_87-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Sometimes with social media, you get a little weary to share your art with the world," she says.

"But my biggest inspirations have been Madam C.J. Walker and Vidal Sassoon. I had always heard about Madam C.J. Walker and what an amazing entrepreneur she was, so many other stylists have looked up to her."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_95-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As for Sassoon, she credits him for taking her skills to the next level.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_97-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"[He] really shaped me as a hairstylist," Kimble says. "I never really could grasp the concept of cutting hair artfully until I attended his academy. He helped me become the hair cutter that I am today."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_99-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Kimble, who has gone from working on TV and movie sets to now having her own haircare line at <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Sally Beauty</a>, drew inspiration from Walker when it came to crafting her formulas.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_101-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Madam C.J.

"Her salons focused mainly on blow-drying curly hair straight. This made me aware of what I wanted to stand for in an industry I shared with my mother.

"I loved everything about the salon experience — from the aroma, to the chatter, to watching the technicians work with various hair types and create different hairstyles. Later in my teenage years, I met an incredible salon owner named <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Lesline Powe-Barton</a>.

But, she still wants to give props to the woman who introduced her to it all in the first place. "[My mother] exposed me to classic styles using pin curls, fingerwaves, roller sets, and wigs, but she also wanted me to see glamorous women who looked more like me," says Rowe. "I was lucky she was a huge fan of Diana Ross."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_135-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Thanks to her mom's vast music collection (and excellent taste), the hairstylist got her first glimps of Ms. Ross as a child. While going through her parent's records, Rowe discovered The Supremes' 1976 LP "Reflections" and the hairstyles on the cover were simply unforgettable.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_137-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The women were wearing these asymmetrical Sassoon-style cuts," she remembers. "I was a little girl who absolutely gagged. I loved the album, but I was so attached to the images on the record. I remember wanting my mom to do my hair like that so bad."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_139-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Of course, Ross has worn many-a-hairstyles over the course of her extraordinary career, which proved to Rowe that Black women don't need to hold back when it comes to beauty, especially our hair, which is something she reminds herself of every time she's on the job. "Diana Ross made me believe anything was possible," she shares. "I really didn't know Black women could have or rock any hairstyle they wanted. My mama was raising kids with hair very different from hers and fell short on the styling front. Textured hair was just out of her wheelhouse and she was busy with a job and a bunch of kids. She instead let me use any of her hair stuff to tinker around and encouraged me to 'play Diana.' Thanks to my mama, I was convinced if Diana could do it, I could too. I just had to figure out how."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_141-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This is <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>All Natural</a>.
