After a six-month wait, AMC’s The Walking Dead finally revealed who met Lucille, the baseball bat covered in barbed wire that Negan used to kill not one but two fan favorites during Sunday’s season seven premiere.
And the victims are …

He would eventually become a key member of Rick’s (Andrew Lincoln) group — and the guy with the best one-liners on the series.</p><p>The AMC version of Abraham outlived his comic book counterpart. On the page, Abraham was killed in The Walking Dead #98 when he is shot through the eye with an arrow — the same way in which the AMC series killed Merritt <span data-scayt_word="Wever's" data-scaytid=14>Wever’s</span> Denise in season six. In the comics, it was Dwight — the reluctant member of <span data-scayt_word="Negan's" data-scaytid=15>Negan’s</span> Saviors — who murders Abraham. (Dwight was also responsible for Denise’s death as well on the series.)</p><p></p><p>Abraham’s death on the AMC series comes as the character seemed to have come full circle. In season six, he was able to overcome his reckless behavior thanks in part to Sasha’s help. Together, they formed a bond — and had a very promising chemistry — that inspired Abraham to leave Rosita (Christian <span data-scayt_word=Serratos data-scaytid=17>Serratos</span>). Abraham’s best use on the series may have been his ability to get through to Eugene, who initially used him for protection. At the end of season six, Eugene had overcome his cowardice and was able to defend himself and fight to protect the group. With his knowledge of how to manufacture ammunition paired with <span data-scayt_word="Negan's" data-scaytid=16>Negan’s</span> deadly arrival, look for Eugene to play a key role in the show’s impending battle against the Saviors.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p>Abraham’s death also leaves Sasha having lost yet another key man in her life. Sasha, who is not in the comics, has been taking on roles played by Andrea — the latter of whose death remains the show’s biggest departure from the comics where she becomes Rick’s love interest.&nbsp;</p><p>Abraham’s death comes as The Walking Dead entered season seven with its largest cast to date — 20 series regulars. &nbsp;What do you think about how The Walking Dead handled Glenn’s death on screen?
