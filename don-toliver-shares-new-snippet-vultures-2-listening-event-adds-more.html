Moreover, new snippets emerged from his social media accounts that are circulating online over his next song "Deep In The Water," which will reportedly come out next Friday (March 15) and features his boo Kali Uchis amid some pretty visuals. Sonically, the teased portions are pretty moody and deeply trap and sultry R&B-inspired, as expected from the Cactus Jack artist. His previous single was more of a hard-hitter, so whatever this woozy direction is, it seems like it will be well-balanced.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Not only that, but Don Toliver also appeared in one of the many tracks, both old and new, that Ye and <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Ty Dolla $ign</a> played at <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">their recent VULTURES 2 listening event</a>. The track reportedly goes by "VENOM / FIELD TRIP" and also features <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Playboi Carti</a> and <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Lil Durk</a>. From what these short clips indicated, it looks to be another banger with his soaring vocals taking up much of the space in it. Whether or not the album will drop soon is another story, but it's definitely in the cards and will likely please fans whenever it lands.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-don-toliver-s-deep-in-the-water-song-snippets-listen>Don Toliver's "Deep In The Water" Song Snippets: Listen</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Meanwhile, Don Toliver has been pretty low-key as of late, most likely celebrating fatherhood and his special relationship with Kali Uchis. Still, that doesn't mean that he didn't kept up with new releases and more material even in smaller ways, such as his new <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Curren$y</a> and Trauma Tone collab, "<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Coming Home</a>." Although fans really want another solo project soon, it wouldn't be too long after 2023's LoveSick, so there's also not a lot of pressure here. Maybe these loosies and high-impact singles will provide a lot of hits for 2024 before the next big step.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-venom-field-trip-off-vultures-2-listen>"VENOM / FIELD TRIP" Off VULTURES 2: Listen</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">But in that regard, what do you think is going to happen with the "<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Worth It</a>" crooner? Is another album dropping soon or are we just blessed with some material he excitedly wanted to drop for fans? In any case, let us know in the comments section down below.

He started in 2022 as a weekend writer and, since joining the team full-time, has developed a strong knowledge in hip-hop news and releases. Whether it’s regular coverage or occasional interviews and album reviews, he continues to search for the most relevant news for his audience and find the best new releases in the genre. What excites him the most is finding pop culture stories of interest, as well as a deeper passion for the art form of hip-hop and its contemporary output. Specifically, Gabriel enjoys the fringes of rap music: the experimental, boundary-pushing, and raw alternatives to the mainstream sound. As a proud native of San Juan, Puerto Rico, he also stays up-to-date with the archipelago’s local scene and its biggest musical exponents in reggaetón, salsa, indie, and beyond. Before working at HotNewHipHop, Gabriel produced multiple short documentaries, artist interviews, venue spotlights, and audio podcasts on a variety of genres and musical figures. Hardcore punk and Go-go music defined much of his coverage during his time at the George Washington University in D.C. His favorite hip-hop artists working today are Tyler, The Creator, Boldy James, JPEGMAFIA, and Earl Sweatshirt.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdnbIBxhZNmm6imXam8rbXVnqlmppWserS7zaBkrKaZpb2mwIyvrKWspaeytHmRZp%2BiqF2dvLF5zZ6urA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./captain-marvel-new-images-reveal-young-nick-fury-skrulls-villain.html><span>←</span><span>Captain Marvel: new images reveal young Nick Fury, Skrulls, villain</span></a>
