<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>Gwendoline Christie Boyfriend, Husband, Height, Weight, Age, Net worth</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><span>Fan- favorite series&nbsp;</span><span>Game of Thrones</span><span>&nbsp;has made quite a number of people famous, and Gwendoline Christie has been on the list of actors for the fantasy drama since 2012.&nbsp;It’s one of many actors that has made her name, and portraying the fascinating life of the warrior Brienne of Tarth has gotten a lot of people fascinated in her as a person.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Gwendoline Christie Biography (Age)</span></strong></h2><p><span>Gwendoline Christie’s full name is GwendolineTracey Philippa Christie and they were born on October 28, 1978 in Worthing, West Sussex.&nbsp;Her life would have been different when she was training to be a gymnast as a child.&nbsp;Unfortunately, she had a spinal injury that forced her to leave the trail.&nbsp;However, Gwendoline Christie did not let this setback affect her greatly and soon found a new passion and a welcome career in acting.</span></p><p><span>With a career in acting as her new goal, she went to the Drama Center London from where she graduated in 2005.&nbsp;School wasn’t exactly easy for her, as there were discouragements at every turn.&nbsp;She was advised by several people that her looks, which included a large physique, weren’t exactly right for an actor and so she would likely never work.&nbsp;Even the agent who was supposed to represent her told her “good luck with that” when she expressed her desire to actually get film roles.&nbsp;Her courage was bolstered by a performance – Tilda Swinton in Orlando.&nbsp;She felt that Tilda Swinton didn’t exactly fit the Hollywood norm, and since she was in a movie, she took it as a sign that she could do it too.</span></p><p><span>Like most actors, before making it big, Gwendoline Christie worked a few odd jobs.&nbsp;She once worked in a Brighton boutique for funky interiors called Pussy.&nbsp;While on the job in 2002, she caught the attention of a photographer because of her size.&nbsp;Christie became the subject of the series of photographers he called Bunny.&nbsp;They were mostly nude and Gwendoline Christie has admitted to being shocked she ever agreed with them, but she also explained that she thought being nude for the camera would help her feel more comfortable with her body.</span></p><p><span>She has had quite a good theatrical career with her roles as Queen in Shakespeare’s Cymbeline and also her portrayal of Mag Wildwood in&nbsp;</span><span>Breakfast at Tiffany</span><span>&nbsp;‘s .&nbsp;However, her dreams of appearing in a film came true with a 2007 short film titled&nbsp;</span><span>The Time Surgeon</span><span>&nbsp;.&nbsp;Christie’s feature film debut came two years later in the 2009 film&nbsp;</span><span>The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus</span><span>&nbsp;, directed by Terry Gilliam.&nbsp;Her career has shown a wide range of talents in&nbsp;</span><span>The Zero Set</span><span>&nbsp;(2013), The Hunger Games&nbsp;</span><span>: Mockingjay – Part 2</span><span>&nbsp;(2015),&nbsp;</span><span>Star Wars: The Last Jedi</span><span>&nbsp;(2017) to her portrayal of Brienne of Tarth in Game of Thrones since 2012 .</span></p><h2><strong><span>your fortune</span></strong></h2><p><span>The Game of Thrones actress is believed to be worth $500,000.&nbsp;She may not have played that many roles before Game of Thrones, but the show has given her more exposure, which has led to greater success and will result in a bigger bankroll in no time.&nbsp;Gwendoline Christie is likely to join the millionaires club soon.</span></p><h2><strong><span>boyfriend or husband, is she married?</span></strong></h2><p><span>Gwendoline Christie is in a stable relationship.&nbsp;She has been with current boyfriend Giles Deacon since 2013.&nbsp;Deacon is a British high-end fashion designer.&nbsp;The two are a perfect match as Deacon considers Gwendoline Christie his muse and she is a particularly stylish person herself, regularly wearing his designs on the red carpet and sitting front row at most of his runway shows.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Gwendoline Christie’s&nbsp;</span></strong><strong><span>height and weight</span></strong></h2><p><span>Gwendoline Christie stands at a height of 6ft, 1.91m and 84kg.&nbsp;Her height may be a blessing now, but she was bullied when she was younger.&nbsp;Now, with her role as Brienne of Tarth in Game of Thrones, it’s perfect.&nbsp;To prepare for the role, she began training with a trainer so she could build muscle and look more like a skilled horseman who could also fight with swords.</span></p><h3 class=main-box-title>You may also like</h3><p class=postsid
