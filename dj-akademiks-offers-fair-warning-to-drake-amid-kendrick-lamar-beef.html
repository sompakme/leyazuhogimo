"I be with some bodyguards like Whitney," he rapped on the cut, referencing his security detail and Whitney Houston's role in the film The Bodyguard. However, the real notable aspect of this bar is that K.Dot's partner's name is Whitney Alford, and the common interpretation is that The Boy is claiming that she cheated on him with his bodyguards. As DJ Akademiks recently explained on his livestream, this is a very dangerous game for him to play again considering how this worked out for him the first time.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Drake... you did the same thing twice now," DJ Akademiks pointed out. "You mentioned Virginia Williams or whatever, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Pusha T</a>'s wife. And you saw that n***a took the gloves off, and we saw what happened. You mentioned Whitney, and Kendrick Lamar's wife's name is Whitney. You have to be prepared for anything! There is no, 'Oh, nah, I can't believe you said that.' No! 'Cause you're talking crazy already, too. <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">This is a knock-them-out slugfest</a>, this is no holds barred, this is, 'I don't care what that n***a says!' He could expose..."</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-dj-akademiks-warning-to-drake-over-mentioning-kendrick-lamar-s-wife>DJ Akademiks' Warning To Drake Over Mentioning Kendrick Lamar's Wife</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Furthermore, this is a hot topic of debate for rap fans now, especially those who remember the savagery of Pusha T's "The Story Of Adidon." Still, DJ Akademiks still thinks that Drake has the leg-up right now, and that Kendrick Lamar is "<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">on the clock</a>" to respond quickly with a retort. Many continue to debate over whether either MC can really beat the other, considering the wildly different lanes they occupy. Also, it seems like no matter what happens in this beef, neither fanbase will ever be able to reconcile with the other.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Meanwhile, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">who do you think will "win" this showdown</a>? Does the Whitney bar pose a grave threat to the 6ix God now or is the Compton lyricist the more affected target? However you may feel, drop your thoughts in the comments section down below.

He started in 2022 as a weekend writer and, since joining the team full-time, has developed a strong knowledge in hip-hop news and releases. Whether it’s regular coverage or occasional interviews and album reviews, he continues to search for the most relevant news for his audience and find the best new releases in the genre. What excites him the most is finding pop culture stories of interest, as well as a deeper passion for the art form of hip-hop and its contemporary output. Specifically, Gabriel enjoys the fringes of rap music: the experimental, boundary-pushing, and raw alternatives to the mainstream sound. As a proud native of San Juan, Puerto Rico, he also stays up-to-date with the archipelago’s local scene and its biggest musical exponents in reggaetón, salsa, indie, and beyond. Before working at HotNewHipHop, Gabriel produced multiple short documentaries, artist interviews, venue spotlights, and audio podcasts on a variety of genres and musical figures. Hardcore punk and Go-go music defined much of his coverage during his time at the George Washington University in D.C. His favorite hip-hop artists working today are Tyler, The Creator, Boldy James, JPEGMAFIA, and Earl Sweatshirt.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdnbYVxhZRmm6uZm5p6rLHNnamim5tiuaK5wKtknaGjqHq4tcWeZJqjkZmyrrXKrGSwmaKjtq%2BzjKGgqWWYpL1uusSwqg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./cheryl-richardson-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html><span>←</span><span>Cheryl Richardson Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</span></a>
