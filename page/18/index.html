<a href=../../will-sevin-5-kill-yellow-jackets.html></a>
Answer
Carbaryl (Sevin) is a 5-percent carbaryl solution that is extremely effective at killing bees and wasps due to the sensitivity of these insects to this product. A product such as Whitmire PT Wasp Freeze II, which is an aerosol spray, may be effective in situations where a visible nest is present.
Is it permissible for me to use Sevin to eliminate yellow jackets in this situation? There are several highly effective options available from the GardenTech® brand that will kill yellow jackets on contact and protect treated areas for up to three months.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>17 Shirt and Skirt Combos for Summer</h2><time>Sep 19, 2024</time>
