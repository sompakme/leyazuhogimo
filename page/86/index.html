Now, HipHopDX has filed a defamation lawsuit against 50 Cent for allegedly trying to sabotage their brand through social media posts.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>9 Celebrity Hairstylists Share the Hair Heroes They Look Up To</h2><time>Aug 5, 2024</time>

Celebrity hairstylists are responsible for the looks we see on the red carpet, as well as on the covers of magazines, albums, and in many cases Instagrams that are made to look DIY — the same looks that we all take to our salons when we're ready to update our hair. But while many have reached star status themselves, stylists often come from humble beginnings. And they've never forgotten the people who either inspired them to get into the hair business, or gave them their first real shot.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Bill Blass Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</h2><time>Aug 5, 2024</time>

I went to Capri last September and have regretted not going to the island's Prada store every single day since I left. The store is apparently beautiful and unlike any other Prada store with windows facing the most beautiful ocean view, but the location is not the only thing that makes it unique. With every purchase over $1,000, you don't get your Prada item packaged up in the regular shopping tote and gift wrap, but instead, a Prada beach tote bag exclusive to only three locations around the world.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Jerome Jackson Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</h2><time>Aug 5, 2024</time>

In a 2003 episode, Hilton shocked her hosts during dinner when she played dumb and asked, “What is Walmart? Do they sell walls there?” The line became a Hilton signature and has recently found new life on social media as memes and stitched viral clips.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Paul Walker Dies in Car Accident at Age 40</h2><time>Aug 5, 2024</time>
