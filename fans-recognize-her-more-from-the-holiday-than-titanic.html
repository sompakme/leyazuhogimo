It’s our little ritual at Christmas.’ And they have things that they eat every year. They sit down, it’s a tradition, and I just love that,” Winslet added. “That’s something I never would have expected, this sort of mother-daughter connection around a film like that. It’s so nice. It’s lovely.”</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The actress starred alongside Jack Black, Jude Law and Cameron Diaz in the 2006 rom-com, which followed two women with guy problems who decide to swap homes in each other’s countries, and they each end up meeting a local guy and falling in love.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">As for 1997’s Titanic, where Winslet starred opposite <a href=# id=auto-tag_leonardo-dicaprio_1 data-tag=leonardo-dicaprio>Leonardo DiCaprio</a>, it followed a teen aristocrat who falls in love with a kind but poor artist aboard the luxurious, ill-fated RMS Titanic. Winslet’s role as Rose earned her an Oscar nomination for best leading actress.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Earlier during her conversation with Fallon, the host shared that he and <a href=# id=auto-tag_robert-downey-jr_1 data-tag=robert-downey-jr>Robert Downey Jr.</a> also auditioned for The Holiday but lost out on roles.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“This is a really real story, which I remember extremely well. I really do,” Winslet recalled. So we were sort of told that you [Fallon] were coming in to do, well I thought it was just like a reading, we were just going to have a fun read of the script. I didn’t realize you were auditioning for the part. I’m so sorry you didn’t get it.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">She also remembered Fallon being “very sick, and you were obsessively hand sanitizing, and I thought, ‘OK, he’s one of those people.'” The host confirmed he was sick during the audition for the rom-com but thought at the time, “This is an opportunity of a lifetime to act with you guys.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The Avatar: The Way of Water actress proceeded to recall Downey doing an English accent during his audition for The Holiday, “but I thought he was doing Australian and I thought, ‘That’s bad, that’s not gonna work. Who’s gonna tell him that? That sounds dreadful.'”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Fallon said he also heard the Iron Man star doing an Australian accent but he thought “it sounded great. This is perfect, but I don’t think the character is supposed to be Australian.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Winslet quipped with a laugh, “It wasn’t actually that great, but that’s really sweet of you to say that.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8yoraKdo2S6sMLInmSnnaeofKyt055ksKGeqLmmwIyrnJynl6O2u7HDZqSoqpViwamxjKGmpaGUlsZuwMeapWasmamur7XCZmhra2VtgHp%2Blm5m</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bad-bunny-x-adidas-gazelle-indoor-san-juan-gets-official-images.html><span>←</span><span>Bad Bunny x Adidas Gazelle Indoor San Juan Gets Official Images</span></a>
