And given how much momentum he's gained through singles like "What's Poppin" and "Tyler Herro," Harlow has had no issue expanding his social circle, as evidenced by the blistering duet with <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Lil Baby</a> "Face Of My City."&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Fueled by a seething synth instrumental from CuBeatz and <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Sonny Digital</a>, who work atmospheric wonders with a simple arrangement, Harlow sets it off with a few key flexes. As has been his way, he manages to conjure up several different ways to exude dominance, making it clear that doing so doesn't exhaust him in the slightest. In fact, Harlow barely bats an eyelash as he raps, delivering his bars with the weary, borderline unimpressed manner of the prematurely jaded. Lil Baby brings a little more intensity to his closing verse, his chemistry with Harlow&nbsp;solid as he fires off warning shots. "I ain't beefing with them ni*gas, they kids," he raps. "I should put 'em over my knee and spank 'em/ I was thinking that they would've been thankful."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Tummy tuck it one time, she'll pay to stay skinny<br>I done been on that road, I done ate some great Denny's<br>And some Cracker Barrel<br>Little brother with mе selling Jack apparel<br>She a rich girl, shе done had Camaros</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdjZYVzf49moZqbm2K1or7LqK5mmZ6Zeq21y2aZmpqpYrCwus2emq1llqS%2FbrLAnJxmp5Ziurp5wqKrsmWemsRuv86nng%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-much-money-does-the-winner-of-i-m-a-celebrity-make.html><span>←</span><span>How much money does the winner of I'm a Celebrity make?</span></a>
