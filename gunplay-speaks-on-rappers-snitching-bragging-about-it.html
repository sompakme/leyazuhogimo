Moreover, the Miami rapper recently sat down for an interview with Cam Capone News, addressing a wealth of topics. Specifically, he lamented how the culture and game has shifted so much that MCs can now snitch and brag about it on their tracks. Furthermore, he spoke particularly on the <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Boosie Badazz</a> <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">arrest that went down recently</a>, but his comments apply to other situations as well. While his comments on male and female rappers seem a tad unrelated, the 43-year-old's point still came across with passion.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"It don’t matter,” Gunplay expressed said. “People don’t care about the integrity like that- the street code, and having integrity like that, it’s just gone. You can snitch now, and it’s okay. You can actually snitch and brag about it. You can be a male rapper one day, and the next day be a female rapper. It’s okay. And then, one day, you know, you can be married one day- and then the next day, be married to a f***in’ giraffe or some s**t, or a tree.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-gunplay-s-disappointment-with-snitching-rappers>Gunplay's Disappointment With Snitching Rappers</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Look at the game, man!" the Carol City MC continued. "Look at this s**t! You don’t see this s**t? Am I the only one seeing this s**t? It’s over. Morals is gone." Of course, people have their own takes, experiences, and interpretations when it comes to these topics. One thing's for sure, though: Gunplay lives by a strict moral compass when it comes to his beliefs. When people <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">sought refunds for their GoFundMe donations to him</a> after he bought his close collaborator a chain under unrelated circumstances, he went scorched earth on them. The campaign was actually to finance his daughter's medical bills after emergency heart surgery.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Every single one of you p***y-a** h*es and f**k n***as that went to the GoFundMe and donated and went and got a motherf***ing refund, you never gave it with your heart,” he said during a&nbsp;We In Miami interview. “You’re a piece of s**t. You’ll die that way. People that see me give my brother a gift, they automatically want to say that I bought that with GoFundMe money. N***a had to pay that back. So now, if you really want to be for real, my n***a, if a n***a spent that on a chain, how the f**k they got it right back instantly with no pressure?"

He started in 2022 as a weekend writer and, since joining the team full-time, has developed a strong knowledge in hip-hop news and releases. Whether it’s regular coverage or occasional interviews and album reviews, he continues to search for the most relevant news for his audience and find the best new releases in the genre. What excites him the most is finding pop culture stories of interest, as well as a deeper passion for the art form of hip-hop and its contemporary output. Specifically, Gabriel enjoys the fringes of rap music: the experimental, boundary-pushing, and raw alternatives to the mainstream sound. As a proud native of San Juan, Puerto Rico, he also stays up-to-date with the archipelago’s local scene and its biggest musical exponents in reggaetón, salsa, indie, and beyond. Before working at HotNewHipHop, Gabriel produced multiple short documentaries, artist interviews, venue spotlights, and audio podcasts on a variety of genres and musical figures. Hardcore punk and Go-go music defined much of his coverage during his time at the George Washington University in D.C. His favorite hip-hop artists working today are Tyler, The Creator, Boldy James, JPEGMAFIA, and Earl Sweatshirt.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdmbn10gI9mnq6moKGuunnRmqepnaKoerS6yK2aoaGenHqjvsCgnqKmlw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./celebrity-fitness-latest-news-pictures-videos.html><span>←</span><span>Celebrity Fitness: Latest News, Pictures &amp;amp; Videos</span></a>
