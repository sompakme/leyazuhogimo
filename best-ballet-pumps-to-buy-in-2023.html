And, since we spent the last decade absolutely obsessed with everything Nineties, and are currently seeing the unexpected return of low-rise jeans, cargo pants and maxi denim skirts, it is quite safe to say that we are about to go through the next 10 years revisiting our favourite trends from the 2000s. Therefore, it is not a huge surprise that ballet pumps are well and truly back on the high-fashion radar. First re-emerging in the spring/summer 2021 collections, the shoe has been seen everywhere for the past few seasons, from Dior and Chanel to Miu Miu, the latter of which created something of a cult item, which is <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.instagram.com/p/CnlJoeHtNGp/?hl=en" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="currently being championed by the likes of Bella Hadid" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">currently being championed by the likes of Bella Hadid</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As one of the favourite footwear trends of the Noughties, the mere mention of the ballet pump might take your mind immediately to Kate Moss or Sienna Miller pairing their leather flats with spray-on skinny jeans or floaty boho skirts. Or, if you’re anything like me, it might bring to mind the seriously worn-out Topshop pumps you wore again and again (long after they should have been thrown away) during nights out at university.</p><img alt="kate moss" title="Celebrity Sightings In London - June 29, 2011" width=2082 height=3510 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/kate-moss-sighted-in-notting-hill-on-june-29-2011-in-london-news-photo-1674208684.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Neil Mockford</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><img alt="sienna miller" title="Sienna Miller Departs from The Wyndham's Theatre in London - August 9, 2005" width=1736 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/sienna-miller-during-sienna-miller-departs-from-the-news-photo-1674208738.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Niki Nikolova</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This image may not have you racing to invest in another pair. However, unlike some of the questionable trends, like chokers, that have resurfaced over the past few years, I am here to convince you that the ballet pump is actually a fashion classic, a timeless shoe that should never fall out of fashion again and one that, in a new era that champions wear-forever staples, is something every woman should have in her wardrobe.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Although the ballet pump was undoubtedly wildly popular in the 2000s, the simple shoe’s place in fashion of course dates back much further than this to the 1950s, which is when the pump first took on a new life away from dance. In fact, most credit Rose Repetto’s designs for the introduction of the ballet flat into the fashion sphere. The footwear designer created a pair for Brigitte Bardot to wear in the movie And God Created Woman and later for Audrey Hepburn in Funny Face, the combination of which launched the simple ballet pump into becoming an extremely popular style of shoe for women all over the world.</p><img alt="audrey hepburn" title="Funny Face - 1956" width=6108 height=4581 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/audrey-hepburn-1618332528.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Shutterstock</span><p>Audrey Hepburn in ’Funny Face’</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Since then, the ballet flat has fallen in and out of fashion, certainly having its moments of heightened popularity (like in the 2000s) but it is a trend that continues to re-emerge time and time again – one which isn’t really a trend at all, but a classic style that we always come back to.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“They are a great investment because they are a timeless style that never dates,” Cassie Smart, head of womenswear buying at Matches Fashion tells me. “You may wear them one year and not the next, but you will certainly always go back to them.”</p><img alt="chanel spring summer 2022" title="Chanel : Runway - Paris Fashion Week - Womenswear Spring Summer 2022" width=3045 height=4569 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/model-walks-the-runway-during-the-chanel-womenswear-spring-news-photo-1674208927.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Estrop</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><img alt="miu miu" title="Miu Miu: Runway - Paris Fashion Week - Womenswear F/W 2022-2023" width=3302 height=4954 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/model-walks-the-runway-during-the-miu-miu-womenswear-fall-news-photo-1674208956.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Pascal Le Segretain</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">They are a fashion staple – and Smart credits the simplicity and versatility of the design for their timelessness. “It works hard in your wardrobe,” she says. “It is a very flattering shape and can be styled with everything from denim to dresses at every length.”</p><img alt="camille charriere" title='"Le Raphia" Jacquemus Show : Photocall At Le Bourget' width=683 height=1024 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/camille-charriere-wears-a-black-and-white-striped-see-news-photo-1674208446.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Edward Berthelot</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><img alt="bella hadid" title="Celebrity Sightings In New York City - October 09, 2022" width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/bella-hadid-is-seen-in-tribeca-on-october-09-2022-in-new-news-photo-1674208509.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Gotham</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Heather Gramston, head of womenswear buying at Browns, agrees: “The ballet pump is an enduring and timeless shape that you can never get bored of – it is practical yet chic and you can wear it day or night.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">And, there might be another reason that we are feeling particularly drawn to ballet pumps at the moment, and it comes down to the fact that they basically resemble a slipper.
