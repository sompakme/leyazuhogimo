As the subjects hallucinated, researchers saw parts of their brains light up that normally have nothing to do with sight. Their senses were becoming intertwined.</p><p>As Carhart-Harris explained, this means that when LSD users say they’ve experienced an altered state of consciousness, they really mean it.</p><p>“Normally our brain consists of independent networks that perform separate specialized functions, such as vision, movement and hearing,” he said. “However, under LSD the separateness of these networks breaks down and instead you see a more integrated or unified brain.”</p><p>Carhart-Harris said this may even explain the feeling of “ego dissolution” experienced by many LSD users. Instead of feeling like an individual with a specific set of senses, “the normal sense of self is broken down and replaced by a sense of reconnection with themselves, others and the natural world.”</p><p>Wow, man.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEnZiipKmXsqK%2F02eaqKVfq7alsc6sZmtoYWt8cYCOamlopKOZera%2FxKuqZquVmnq4tdOhZK2glZ6%2FbrHYnqpmm5ykwKaw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kendall-jenner-wore-cuup-s-balconette-mesh-bra-and-thongs.html><span>←</span><span>Kendall Jenner Wore Cuups Balconette Mesh Bra and Thongs</span></a>
