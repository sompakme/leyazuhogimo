By Chris Snellgrove | Updated 12 months ago Ever since James Gunn became co-chairman and co-CEO of DC Studios, he decided to shake things up by ditching most of the established actors except for Margot Robbie in order to create a more unified DCU anchored by newer actors. The highest-profile actor to get the big red boot was Henry Cavill as Superman but now, after much hemming and hawing (including the cancellation of her third solo film), it looks like Gal Gadot is going to be replaced as Wonder Woman."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

The highest-profile actor to get the big red boot was Henry Cavill as Superman but now, after much hemming and hawing (including the cancellation of her third solo film), it looks like <a href=#>Gal Gadot</a> is going to be replaced as Wonder Woman. We at Giant Freakin Robot recently conducted a poll on Twitter to see who fans wanted to replace Gadot as the famous Amazonian warrior, and Ana de Armas handily won the poll.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Who would you rather have as the new Wonder Woman?</p>— GIANT FREAKIN ROBOT (@GFRobot) <a href=#>March 7, 2023</a></figure><p>Back when Wonder Woman was first being cast, many didn’t know who Gal Gadot was until they discovered she’d be portraying the world’s most famous <a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# rel=noopener title=Amazon data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>Amazon</a> onscreen (unless, of course, they were big fans of The Fast and the Furious films, of which Gadot starred in two franchise entries).</p><p>The same can’t be said for Ana de Armas, who has been quietly establishing herself as a popular and reliable actor in some very high-profile genre films. This included starring in Blade Runner 2049 alongside <a href=#>Ryan Gosling</a> as Joi, an ethereal holographic girlfriend quite possibly named after a kind of online video you might search for when you’re lonely.</p><p>And even as everyone tries to figure out who is going to portray the next James Bond (we really did have our hearts set on <a href=#>Idris Elba</a>), Ana de Armas has starred alongside previous Bond star Daniel Craig on two different occasions. She starred as Marta Cabrera in the popular Rian Johnson film Knives Out, and she later reunited with Craig to star in No Time to Die as Paloma, a CIA intelligence operative.</p><p>In other words, she knows how to handle her own in blockbuster movies and is a natural when it comes to action scenes, both of which would be assets if she took the role of Wonder Woman after Gal Gadot hangs up the blue panties.</p><p>In fact, one of the few things that might make Ana de Armas a poor replacement for Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman is her age. As of this writing, Ana de Armas is only 34 years old, but Gunn seems to be focusing on casting younger actors who can headline these tentpole superhero movies for another decade or more.</p><p>Gal Gadot was 31 when she first appeared as Wonder Woman and has now effectively been retired from the role at the tender age of 37. So Ana de Armas being only three years younger than the woman she might replace could be a problem for Gunn and his vision of the DCU.</p><p>Regardless of whether Ana de Armas ever replaces Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman, we can agree that both women have very impressive film resumes and some awesome projects around the corner. For example, Gadot will be starring as Cleopatra in a movie of the same name as well as playing the Evil Queen in a live-action version of the <a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# rel=noopener title=Disney data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>Disney</a> hit Snow White.</p><p>And de Armas will appear alongside Chris Evans in Ghosted and alongside both <a href=#>Keanu Reeves</a> and Norman Reedus in Ballerina. No Lasso of Truth is needed to make us say that each of these actors has a bright future ahead of them, but should either want to tie us up, well…we wouldn’t necessarily object.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2iZnpZ6pbGMmqmmmaNixLC6w56pZq%2Bfoq6vesetpKU%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./amy-robach-wows-in-bikini-inside-lavish-kitchen-in-new-york-home.html><span>←</span><span>Amy Robach wows in bikini inside lavish kitchen in New York home</span></a>
