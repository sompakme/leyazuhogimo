In the video, Ashley was seen violently charging at the other car's driver and throwing racist questions at them for allegedly hitting her car. The incident reportedly took place in San Diego.</p><p>The video was initially shared on May 18 on TikTok by @sam.anthabong, who seemed unaware of Ashley's identity. The user asked viewers to spread the clip so that the woman in the video could be identified as nobody deserved to be treated like that. The video was reposted on Twitter by @rx0rcist, and some people identified the woman as Ashley Barkis.</p><p>Ashley, who goes by the name 'SAVAGE' on Instagram, quickly went private. Twitter user @Rossi_Messi23 wrote that Ashley claims to be a savage and acts like an animal, adding that she should go to jail for this incident.</p><p>One person mentioned on Twitter that Ashley was later <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-is-sponsored=false>arrested</a>, though there has been no official confirmation of it.</p><h2>Netizens call Ashley Barkis a racist and a bigot</h2><p>The text overlay in the viral video claimed that a friend of the creator's friend got into the accident and received racist remarks aside from getting physically assaulted by the other driver.</p><p>Ashley's attitude towards the people in the other car, who appeared to be Asian, infuriated the internet. They demanded Ashley's arrest for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-is-sponsored=false>attempting to murder</a> the other driver by pushing him into the approaching traffic.</p><p>According to Ashley's LinkedIn bio, she works as a sales manager at a gym called 24 Hour Fitness. Some people tagged the gym in the Twitter video and asked them to hold their employee accountable for her unacceptable behavior. The gym responded that Ashley had not been their team member for several years.</p><h3>Ashley pushed the other driver into the oncoming traffic</h3><p>Ashley Barkis aggressively charged at the people from the other car, who appeared to be Asian. She alleged that the other driver hit her car and asked him where his insurance was and if he had a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-is-sponsored=false>driver's license</a> or if he was even legal to be in America.</p><p>When the other driver pulled out his driver's license and showed it to Ashley, she violently threw it away and started physically assaulting the man and the people with him. At one point, Ashley kicked the man into the moving traffic, who landed dangerously close to a speeding car.</p><p>The viral video also showed the photos of bruises that the other driver's family members received by being hit by Ashley.</p><p>According to some social media users, Ashley is an influencer who posts videos of her song covers on Instagram. However, she seemed to have deleted or deactivated her Instagram and TikTok account after people started commenting on her posts regarding the incident.</p><p>The identities of the people from the other car whom Ashley Barkis assaulted are not yet known. It is also not known whether the family filed a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-is-sponsored=false>legal complaint</a> against the young woman.</p><p class=article-p>Quick Links</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/staticg.sportskeeda.com/skm/assets/article/article-scroll-left.svg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/staticg.sportskeeda.com/skm/assets/article/article-scroll-right.svg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p>More from Sportskeeda</p>" modalPopup.closeOnEsc = false; modalPopup.setHeader("Why did you not like this content?"); modalPopup.setContentText(modalText); modalPopup.addCancelOkButton("Submit", resetRatingAndFeedbackForm, sendRating); modalPopup.removeCloseModalIcon(); modalPopup.disableDismissPopup(); modalPopup.open(); } else { sendRating(index); } } function sendRating() { var requestPayload = { "post_id": 1514904, "rating_value": ratingValue } if (ratingValue > 3) { requestPayload.rating_feedback_type = null; requestPayload.rating_feedback = null; } else { if (!$('input[name="drone"]:checked') || !$('input[name="drone"]:checked').value) { showErrorMessage('option'); return; } if (!$(".post-rating-feedback-note textarea") || !$(".post-rating-feedback-note textarea").value) { showErrorMessage('note'); return; } var selectedOption = $('input[name="drone"]:checked').value; var feedbackNote = $(".post-rating-feedback-note textarea").value; requestPayload.rating_feedback_type = selectedOption; requestPayload.rating_feedback = feedbackNote; } pureJSAjaxPost(addratingAPI, requestPayload, onsaveRatingSuccess, onsaveRatingFail, function() {}, true); } function resetRatingAndFeedbackForm() { var activeStars = Array.from($all('.rating span.rating-star.active')); for (var i=0; i &lt; activeStars.length; i++) { activeStars[i].classList.remove("active"); } if ($('input[name="drone"]:checked')) { $('input[name="drone"]:checked').checked = false; } var userNote = document.querySelector(".post-rating-feedback-note textarea"); userNote.value = ''; modalPopup.close(); } function onsaveRatingSuccess() { modalPopup.close(); savePostIdInUserRatedPostsCookie(); $("#post-rating-layout").classList.add("hidden"); $("#post-rating-message").classList.remove("hidden"); window.setInterval(function showMessage() { $("#post-rating-widget").classList.add("hidden"); }, 3000); } function onsaveRatingFail() { console.error('Saving post rating failed!'); modalPopup.close(); } function savePostIdInUserRatedPostsCookie() { userRatedPostIds.push(1514904); var expiryTime = new Date(); expiryTime.setMonth(expiryTime.getMonth() + 12); // Expiry after 1 year setCookie("user_rated_post_ids", JSON.stringify(userRatedPostIds), expiryTime); } function isPostRatedByUser() { var userRatedPostIds = getCookie('user_rated_post_ids'); if (userRatedPostIds) { try { userRatedPostIds = JSON.parse(userRatedPostIds); } catch (err) { console.error(err); return false; } } else { return false; } if(userRatedPostIds.indexOf(1514904) >= 0) { return true; } else { return false; } } function getRatingCountByPostId(postId) { return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) { pureJSAjaxGet( getRatingCountBaseURL + postId + '/rating/count', function(data) { try { data = JSON.parse(data); if (data.meta_value) { resolve(data.meta_value); } reject("Failed to fetch rating count for the post:" + postId); } catch (err) { reject("Failed to fetch rating count for the post:" + postId); } }, function(err) { reject("Failed to fetch rating count for the post:" + postId); }, true); }); } function showErrorMessage(messageType) { var messageContainerId = '#' + messageType + '-error'; $(messageContainerId).classList.remove('hidden'); window.setInterval(function () { $(messageContainerId).classList.add("hidden"); }, 5000); } (function() { var callFired = false; function lazyLoadPostRating() { if (callFired) return; callFired = true; if (!isPostRatedByUser()) { getRatingCountByPostId(1514904) .then(function(ratingCount) { if (ratingCount &lt; 10) { $("#post-rating-widget").classList.remove("hidden"); } }) .catch(function(err){ console.error(err); }); } } document.addEventListener("scroll", lazyLoadPostRating, { passive: true, once: true }); document.addEventListener("mousemove", lazyLoadPostRating, { passive: true, once: true }); document.addEventListener("touchmove", lazyLoadPostRating, { passive: true, once: true }); })();<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLzOq6uso5WasaJ6wqikaKifpXqkwcutrKudX6OyuL%2BMoaapnV2cvKa%2FjKOYoqRdqbWqv4yaqqGkla56o63RpKCsZZOWv26twpygnZ2eqXq3tcOepmaklZbDpr%2BMp5ytoaqau7R5y6KtopxdZ4FutM6uqWaemam7pr%2FSZqmeq6Cku6W%2F</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./abeg-who-buy-u-new-shoe-funny-reactions-as-oga-sabinus-shares-lovely-moments-from-his-new-mov.html><span>←</span><span>Abeg Who Buy U New Shoe?
