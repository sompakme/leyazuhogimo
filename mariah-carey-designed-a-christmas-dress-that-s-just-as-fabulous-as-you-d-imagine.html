And while some of us may still be grasping tightly onto our pumpkin spice lattes and all things Halloween for the time being, Carey is getting the Christmas season started early with the help of her favorite seasonal tunes (yes, that includes “All I Want for Christmas Is You”), quality family time, and a fresh and festive holiday wardrobe courtesy of her new collaboration with The Children’s Place (available now).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“When The Children’s Place first approached me about collaborating and chatted about who their audience is, I knew that we could design and bring their Millennial mom a beautiful, limited-edition piece that is perfect for the holidays,” Carey tells InStyle of the brand’s latest Holiday Collection, which features a gown titled “The Dress,” designed by the unofficial Queen of Christmas herself.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“The dress is truly mesmerizing,” she continues. “I had a vision of elegance … a stunning red ball gown with a ton of volume. ‘The Dress’ is delicately crafted in a rich red velour, the strapless fitted bodice flares out to a mesmerizing, full A-line skirt for an iconic silhouette. This limited-edition style flaunts a festive plaid satin trim at the neck and waist that wraps around the back, complete with an oversized bow for an elegant touch of glamour.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-low-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Courtesy The Children's Place</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It’s this very design (priced at $149) that Carey says helps create her “own version of holiday fashion magic” throughout the season, going hand-in-hand with what she considers to be the perfect holiday outfit combination: “Anything that makes you feel confident, fabulous, festive, and ready to celebrate,” she shares.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But the new collection’s stunning offerings don’t just stop at “The Dress” — Carey ensured that people of all ages (including her 12-year-old twins, Monroe and Moroccan, whom she shares with ex Nick Cannon) could get in on the holiday fun, too, by designing matching The Children’s Place looks for the entire family.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“The twins love to dress up as much as I do during the holidays, and I love that they experiment with fashion,” Carey explains. “The twins and I had the best time in our matching pajamas and coordinated holiday looks when we shot the campaign. We could truly feel the Christmas magic, and I know we all looked and felt amazing in the outfits.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Carey shares that while these new holiday moments are definitely the ones she’ll cherish for years, nothing will compare to her children’s very first Christmas.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Each holiday season is special and unique to me, but my fondest memory would have to be Roc and Roe’s first Christmas,” she says. “To see them grow each year and embrace the spirit of the holiday season is the gift that keeps on giving. Seeing the joy in their eyes on every Christmas morning is a memory I will never forget.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“The Dress” and Mariah’s complete holiday collection with The Children’s Place is available now at <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>www.childrensplace.com</a>.&nbsp;<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zJqpopmYYrCivsSyZK2glWKxs7HSrGScoJmhsbOxzaxkqaSRmLJur8eroKysnZbAbq%2FOpaOem6SevK95l2xscG1kaQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./luka-don%C4%8Di%C4%87-net-worth-2024.html><span>←</span><span>Luka Doni Net Worth 2024</span></a>
