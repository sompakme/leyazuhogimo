Each artist has come through with a new album in the first five months. The former delivered One of Wun earlier this month, with a heavy focus on his new mindset and personal growth. As for the latter, the Afro-pop act gave her growing Tygers (her fans) fan base a full dosage of what she can do on an LP with her self-titled debut. One song from the album that listeners have taken a liking to is the Gunna and Skillibeng collaboration, "Jump."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The song has climbed up the ranks quickly, as it is currently Tyla's second-most streamed record at 67.3 million plays. It is outpacing others such as "Truth or Dare," "ART," and "No.1" with Tems. Just yesterday, the track got some extra pampering with its <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">music video</a>. It was shot in Tyla's hometown of Johannesburg, South Africa and while they were down there, they were <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">seen out together</a> in a video reshared by The Neighborhood Talk, which angered some fans.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-gunna-amp-tyla-bts-for-jump-music-video>Gunna & Tyla BTS For "Jump" Music Video</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The reason for them being so upset was because she was partying after canceling her tour due to <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">health issues</a>. Some of her Tygers were claiming that they still had not received refunds as well. Now, more footage of the rapper and singer is out, in what appears to be BTS for the "Jump" video. Fans are not angry this time around, but they are roasting the heck out of Gunna. In the clip, his walking motion seems a bit stiff and awkward, and trolls on X were quick to point that out. One person says, "N**** walking like he slipped a disk in his back." Another joins the comedy show, adding, "He walks like he's going uphill at all time[s] üò≠"</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">What are your thoughts on Gunna sharing some BTS of the "Jump" music video while walking with Tyla?
