During his career, Corrales fought 45 times professionally, winning 40 with 33 of them coming by way of knockout. His first fight was back in 1996 when he was just 18 years old, and he first won the IBF Super-Featherweight Title in 1999 at the age of 22. He lost the belt to Floyd Mayweather Jr. in 2001 in his first professional loss, but quickly got it back in 2004 after defeating Joel Casamayor in a split decision.</p><p dir=ltr>However, Corrales is most well known for his two fights with José Luis Castillo, during which both fighters put on incredibly memorable performances. His career was briefly halted for 14 months between 2001 and 2002 when he was incarcerated for domestic violence against his wife, but it continued after his release.</p><p dir=ltr>Corrales died on May 7, 2007, after he was involved in a multi-car accident. Corrales had previously been arrested for DUI, and it was later revealed that he had more than three times the legal limit of alcohol in his system when he crashed. Corrales left behind a wife and four children, one of whom was not yet born when he passed.</p><p>If you or someone you know is dealing with domestic abuse, you can call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1−800−799−7233.
