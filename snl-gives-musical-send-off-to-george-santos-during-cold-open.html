America hates to see a Latina queen winning since the day I was elected. It’s been a witch hunt but if I’m guilty of anything, it’s for loving too much/fraud.”</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">When one of the reporters asked him how he felt about being the sixth House member in history to be expelled by his colleagues, Yang’s Santos responded, “You want me to say that I lost? That I’m humiliated? Fine. So I’m no longer Congressman Santos. I’m just regular old professor, major, General reverend, astronaut Santos, protector of the realm, princess of Genovia.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Yang’s disgraced congressman then proceeds to break out in song to perform a “tribute to myself.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“Goodbye Congress Queen,” he sings. “Oh, they never knew me at all because I lied about everything in my life and I took a tragic fall.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Yang’s Santos continues to belt out, “It seems to me like I’ve lived my life like an evil Forrest Gump. I’m the guy who lied even too much for Donald Trump.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Santos became the first House member to be expelled in more than 20 years following the House’s vote on Friday. Since arriving in Washington nearly a year ago, Santos has found himself wrapped up in scandals. He is also been indicted on 23 charges, including wire fraud and money laundering, which he has pleaded not guilty to.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Later in the show, during host <a href=# id=auto-tag_emma-stone data-tag=emma-stone>Emma Stone</a>‘s opening monologue, Tina Fey and Candice Bergen joined her onstage in Studio 8H to welcome her into <a href=# id=auto-tag_snl data-tag=snl>SNL</a>‘s coveted Five-Timers Club.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Once they gifted the actress with the Five-Timers Club jacket, Stone joked that it had a joint in the pocket. Bergen quipped in response, “That must be Woody Harrelson’s jacket.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“There’s also a vaccine card in here,” Stone added, to which Fey said, “Then it’s definitely not Woody’s,” referencing when <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/snl-woody-harrelson-covid-19-mandates-conspiracies-1235334744/>Harrelson questioned&nbsp;COVID-19&nbsp;mandates</a> and joked about conspiracy theories while hosting SNL in February.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Noah Kahan also made his SNL&nbsp;debut this weekend as musical guest.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue9OvZq2uXaOyuL%2BOrJitraKZrrp5zaKeoaxdoba3sYygnKiql5p6tK3NraasZZOkuaV5zqmcp2WVorqiedKtpqedXWZ%2FdIGWaW9xcWZk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mike-bowman-raced-his-way-to-over-100k-winnings-before-street-outlaws-wed-16-february-2022-16.html><span>←</span><span> Mike Bowman raced his way to over $100K winnings before Street Outlaws Wed 16 February 2022 16:</span></a>
