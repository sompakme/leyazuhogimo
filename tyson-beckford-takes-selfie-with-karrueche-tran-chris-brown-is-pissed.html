"U wanna keep walking them runways. I need ta legs for that. Keep playin' like I ain't wit the bullshit." He added after, "I'm done all this internet talking blood. Be in Vegas soon. Keep playin' I'ma fuck yo baby mama and whoop your child like it's mine." Breezy, a habitual deleter of tweets, has since removed the tweets from his profile but screenshots can be seen in the gallery above.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Tyson played things off with the tweet below.
