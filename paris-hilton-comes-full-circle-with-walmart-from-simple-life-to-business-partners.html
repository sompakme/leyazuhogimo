<span>Larita Shotwell</span></p><h1>Paris Hilton Comes Full Circle With Walmart from 'Simple Life' to Business Partners</h1></header><section class=post-content><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Back in the early aughts, heiress <a href=# id=auto-tag_paris-hilton_1 data-tag=paris-hilton>Paris Hilton</a> and party pal/BFF Nicole Richie temporarily relocated to Arkansas to portray misplaced socialites doing their best to fit in on a family farm for the Fox <a href=# id=auto-tag_reality_1 data-tag=reality>reality</a> show The Simple Life. In a 2003 episode, Hilton shocked her hosts during dinner when she played dumb and asked, “What is Walmart? Do they sell walls there?”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The line became a Hilton signature and has recently found new life on social media as memes and stitched viral clips. The scene was something Hilton was happy to address in a recent interview to promote her new cookware line, the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Be an Icon collection</a>, which is sold exclusively in (gasp!) Walmart. “This is definitely a full-circle moment — ‘What is Walmart?’ Well, they sell Paris Hilton cookware,” the 42-year-old new mother tells THR. “I obviously knew what Walmart was when I filmed that. I was just playing my Simple Life character at the time.”</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m"><strong>How did you get into business with Walmart?</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">This is my <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">second collection for my cookware line</a>. I was so excited to partner with Walmart because I love going in there, it’s so much fun <a href=# id=auto-tag_shopping_1 data-tag=shopping>shopping</a> there. For me, I really wanted to make cooking in the kitchen more fun because all the cookware on the market is just so boring and so basic. I thought it would be amazing to partner with Walmart to create a really beautiful, pink, girly, glamorous line. The tagline is “Be an Icon” because I feel like everyone should be able to feel like an icon, even in the kitchen.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m"><strong>What’s your favorite item from the line? Is there one you use the most?</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">I am in love with the entire collection. But some of my favorites are the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">heart-shaped charcuterie boards</a> with cute crystal serving knives. It’s great for entertaining when you invite people over. The other day, I was using it to make [a charcuterie board] with crackers, cheese and grapes. Another one had all these sweets on it with cute pink candies. I even made a separate one for my dogs, which was really cute because it had all of their little doggy treats on it. They loved it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Paris-Hilton-Mini-Refrigerator-a.png><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">I’m also obsessed with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the mini-fridges</a>. I love how you can put them on a cool or a warm setting. I have one next to my bed that has all my face sheet masks and my eye masks and everything. It keeps all my skin care and tools nice and cold. I have another one in my Sliving Spa area downstairs, and I keep that one on the warm setting for hot towels when I’m getting a facial. They’re great to use for anything —&nbsp;snacks, food, whatever you need. They are great for holiday gifting to brighten up your home or kitchen in so many ways. I also love that it has a mirror with a light in front so it’s awesome for taking selfies because of the perfect lighting.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/20234465-copy-EMBED-2023.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m"><strong>When I heard about the collection, I did a quick search on Google for “Paris Hilton” and “Walmart.” The prominent result is from your reality show The Simple Life featuring the moment when you said, “What’s Walmart?” What do you remember from that scene and the impact it had? Also, did you think about it when you got in business with Walmart?</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Yeah, of course, that is one of the most iconic lines from The Simple Life: “What is Walmart? Do they sell walls there?” This is definitely a full circle moment where now I know that they don’t sell walls there. “What is Walmart?” Well, they sell Paris Hilton cookware. I love that. I’ve been seeing that scene reposted all over Instagram and TikTok. People make memes and videos reposting it, and it always makes me laugh. I obviously knew what Walmart was when I filmed that. I was just playing my Simple Life character at the time. When I said that at the dinner table, they were all kind of shocked that I didn’t know what Walmart was. It’s a line I will remember for the rest of my life. Now that I have my cookware line there, it’s even more iconic.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m"><strong>WWD recently reported that you entered a deal with IHL Group to partner on ready-to-wear and handbags. In that story, you said how important it is to you that everything you put your name on must have the Paris Hilton vibe or the Paris Hilton DNA. When you’re in business or design meetings, how do you specify precisely what that is?</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">For me, the Paris Hilton vibe is just obviously a lot of pink and sparkle and just having that feel of being Paris-ized. When people wear my clothing or perfumes or buy anything from my collections, I want them to feel empowered to be the most authentic version of themselves. I try to make pieces that are unique and fun, and I’ve always prided myself on being ahead of the time, especially when it comes to fashion. That’s why it’s so amazing to see all these iconic looks that I put together back when I was a teenager with no stylist resurface all over social media and on the runways. Huge brands are recreating them and using them for inspiration for new designs or mood boards. It’s just so incredible. The little girl inside of me would be so proud. That’s what I always want to bring to my collections.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m"><strong>Let’s talk affordability and price points. The IHL Group ready-to-wear line will reportedly be priced in the $68-$395 range. You’re in business with Walmart now, so it feels like you’ve thought about aligning with the right retail partners to make items that are affordable for fans. How do you navigate those decisions?</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">For me, my brand has always been about affordable luxury and making things that are accessible to my fans. I love to get pieces from all around the world, but I want everyone to be able to enjoy them. I always am thinking about price points to make things accessible so that people can feel like they have a piece of me. I partner with stores and groups that make that possible. It’s always in the back of my mind.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/PH11579-AS-BG-copy-EMBED-2023.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m"><strong>I read that children’s clothing is likely to come. How have your aspirations changed since becoming a mother?</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">I am already developing the children’s line now, and it’s so much fun dressing Phoenix up. I can’t wait to have a little girl for all the mommy-and-me looks with matching outfits. I’ve been thinking a lot about that and I’m so excited for Halloween to dress Phoenix up in all these cute costumes. I love having fun with fashion. Designing cute baby looks has been a dream come true. It’s so much fun being in the studio and designing all these new pieces.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m"><strong>You mentioned a baby girl. Are there plans to expand the family already?</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">I can’t wait to have a daughter. That’s always been a dream of mine — to bring a little princess into this world. I’m excited that we have Phoenix and he’s going to be such an amazing big brother. So yeah, stay tuned and we’ll see.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m"><strong>The next season of Paris in Love is coming. After filming the first season for this reality show, was there anything that was off limits this time around?</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">I had so much fun in the first season, showing my whole wedding and the process of getting ready for that. I can’t wait for fans to experience this next chapter that follows me being married and becoming a mother. Ever since I released my documentary, This Is Paris, and my memoir, Paris: The Memoir, I am such an open book. I don’t have anything to hide. I’m so proud of my journey and everything that I’ve been through. For the show, nothing is off-limits. You’ll see me in the hospital with Phoenix when he was born, my relationship with [my husband] Carter, going to Washington, D.C., for my advocacy work, introducing a bill for federal legislation, spending time with my sister and my mom, and balancing being a mother, being in the studio recording my album, running a company, and getting ready for my first live concert at the Fonda Theater.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">I have such a busy, full life and it’s so much fun, but it’s also a lot. I’m so proud of this new season. We’ve been watching all the episodes and I laugh, I cry. There are fun moments but sad moments, too, and I get really emotional watching it. I wanted to show that, in life, people go through everything. I’ve been so vulnerable these last few years sharing my life, and it’s been incredibly healing. There’s such power in sharing your story and your truth.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m"><strong>What’s the biggest challenge in running your media company?</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">One of the biggest challenges is not enough days in the week to get everything done. Every single day I’m getting different offers and people are coming to me with different ideas. I’ve also got a busy schedule of performances and appearances. Honestly, there’s just not enough time to squeeze it all in. I’m saying no to so many things now because I’m a mom and I want to be there for Phoenix as much as possible, so I don’t miss any of his milestones. I’ve learned the word no, which is something that was hard for me before. I’m an Aquarius so I’m a very creative person, and I also have ADHD, so my mind is always racing coming up with new ideas.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">I feel lucky to work with such an incredible team at 11:11 Media. My business partner is Bruce Gersh, the president, and we have so many verticals from television and film to podcasting, music, products, the Metaverse. We talk every single day and go over everything that’s coming in. It’s a lot. I’m also back in the studio and recording my second album. Sia is the executive producer of my new album, and she is just one of the most talented and just beautiful human beings inside and out. She’s been so supportive with my music. I’m also developing my new skin care line and I just released my 29th fragrance with the 30th coming soon. It smells so incredible.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m"><strong>What’s the most lucrative business category?</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">All the fragrance lines have been super successful. I just got back from Bangkok and Malaysia doing appearances for the 29th perfume. It’s amazing to see so many fans loving and enjoying these perfumes for two decades now. It’s cute to see moms coming in with their daughters, a whole new generation. It makes me feel so proud to have built just this whole empire around perfumes. When I was a little girl, my mom had her boudoir filled with her perfumes and my sister and I would go in and spray them on us. We’d feel all grown up. I looked at my mom and said, “One day, I’m going to have my own Paris perfume.” I thought I would have just one. Now, to have the 30th coming out soon is a dream come true. I’m so incredibly proud of everything that I’ve built and worked so hard for.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/1447441361-P-2022.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">A version of this story first appeared in the Oct. 11 issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine. <a href=#>Click here to subscribe</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8uinZ6rpK65pnvLop2eq6SuuaZ5zZ6urGeglr%2Bqv4yhoKWsn6PAbq%2FOqKKwmaKaerity6aYq6xdl7KiwdOyZJuqkaOxtHmQa2pubmFofXZ%2Fjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./madeleine-albright-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html><span>←</span><span>Madeleine Albright Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</span></a>
