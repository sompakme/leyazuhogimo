But I’m starting to feel like the world doesn’t want me in it.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The 35-year-old continued by stating that she’s constantly finding herself up against “lies being told about me for clout and views,” being the butt of the joke “every single time because of how I look” and having her character picked apart by strangers. She closed her emotional post with the words, “I quit” and a peace sign. It’s unclear if she meant she was quitting Instagram or all of her social platforms, though she only shared the image there and not on X (formerly Twitter) or TikTok. Or, perhaps was Lizzo signaling that she’s done with her music career? The Hollywood Reporter has reached out to reps for the singer for clarification.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Friday’s post comes hours after Lizzo faced criticism for performing at a star-studded fundraiser for President Joe Biden that featured Barack Obama and Bill Clinton in conversation with Biden and Stephen Colbert, as well as appearances by Mindy Kaling, Queen Latifah, Ben Platt, Cynthia Erivo and Lea Michele at Radio City Music Hall in New York City. According to The <a rel=nofollow href=#>Associated Press</a>, the event raised $26 million.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Attorneys for Lizzo’s former dancers, who have accused her of sexual harassment and other workplace grievances, blasted her participation in the event. “It’s shameful that Lizzo would be chosen to headline an event like this amid such egregious allegations,” attorney Ron Zambrano told NewsNation. “Without getting into the politics, I can’t imagine why anyone would want Lizzo representing them in any way, given her reprehensible behavior. It’s just a terrible look.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Last August, some of her tour dancers <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/music-news/lizzo-responds-sexual-harassment-hostile-work-allegations-1235549791/>filed a lawsuit </a>against the artist, alleging that they were sexually harassed and victims of a hostile workplace environment. Billboard reported earlier this month that the suit <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.billboard.com/business/legal/lizzo-dancers-sexual-harassment-lawsuit-on-hold-appeal-1235628514/>is now on hold</a> while Lizzo appeals a ruling that allowed the case to move forward. For her part, Lizzo has denied any allegations of wrongdoing.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Shortly after the suit was filed, she <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/music-news/lizzo-responds-sexual-harassment-hostile-work-allegations-1235549791/>defended herself on Instagram</a>. “I am not here to be looked at as a victim, but I also know that I am not the villain that people and the media have portrayed me to be these last few days. There is nothing I take more seriously than the respect we deserve as women in the world. These sensationalized stories are coming from former employees who have already publicly admitted that they were told their behavior on tour was inappropriate and unprofessional.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">A month later, Lizzo hit the stage at The Beverly Hilton to accept the <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/music-news/lizzo-accepts-humanitarian-honor-after-second-lawsuit-1235596775/>Quincy Jones Humanitarian Award</a> at the Black Music Action Coalition gala. She’s made other high-profile appearances in the months since. She turned up to present an award at February’s Grammy Awards, flew to Las Vegas for the Super Bowl and attended Vanity Fair‘s star-studded post Oscars party in Beverly Hills.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8uinZ6rpK65pnvLop2eq6SuuaZ5zZ6urGecnse7u4yqrKKso2K2r7%2FTmp6rmZ1isq6706Kmp5mcYr2wv9NmpqekmaOybrTArZyrq12hrri%2F1KKrZmliaIJ5gpJsaHFn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lacey-croom-age-family-and-children-meet-max-homa-wife-on-instagram.html><span>←</span><span>Lacey Croom Age, Family and Children: Meet Max Homa Wife On Instagram</span></a>
