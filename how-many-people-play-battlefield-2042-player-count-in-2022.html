The average each month in the past year ranged from about 2,000 to just under 8,000.</p><p>That said, the player count saw a huge spike on 22nd November 2022.

As such, it's likely that players can expect at least a small influx of new players in the near future.</p><p>Yes, Battlefield 2042 had a pretty rocky release, with many players expressing their disappointment with some aspects of the game and the lack of updates. This first-person shooter is starting to find its footing, though, with a large influx of players coming in after its release on Xbox Game Pass and the start of Season 3.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ginx.tv/imgcdn/rTgBoC8tZotimuE0522xWijQSDnkLPNrCdtHl5PPkDM/rs:fill:0:0:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2lueC50di91cGxvYWRzMi9CYXR0bGVmaWVsZC9CYXR0bGVmaWVsZF8yMDQyL0JhdHRsZWZpZWxkXzIwNDJfb3Blbl9iZXRhLmpwZw><p>That's all you need to know about Battlefield 2042's player count in 2022, including how many players participate in the game each month on average, and whether or not players should expect an influx of newbies.</p><p><strong>For more fantastic game content, check out our section dedicated to&nbsp;</strong><a href=#><strong>Battlefield 2042 news, updates, guides, features</strong></a><strong>, and more.</strong></p><p>Featured image courtesy of Electronic Arts.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ginx.tv/imgcdn/UuUZXmR4L6DWxf9VSjP8nkkns7QWsT9i-jFJjfumcP0/rs:fill:180:180:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2lueC50di91cGxvYWRzMi8xX1N0YWZmX1Bob3Rvcy90ZW1wX0NvbGUuanBn alt="Cole Podany" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>Written by <a href=#>Cole Podany</a></h3><p>Cole is a Staff Writer at GINX Esports TV based in the United States.
