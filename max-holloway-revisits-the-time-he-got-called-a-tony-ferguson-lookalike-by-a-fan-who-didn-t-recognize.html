While recalling the incident, the former <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-is-sponsored=false>UFC </a>featherweight champion said:</p>"The worked comes up, he goes, 'Yo, dude, bro, anybody ever told you. you look like Tony Ferguson.' I kind just waived it off like, 'Yeah, cool.' He was like, 'Yo man, you don't know what UFC is?' And I was like, 'Yeah, I know what UFC is, actually, that's funny because a lot of people tell me that, when they talk about UFC, that I look like Max Holloway. You know, the champ guy?' And he's like, 'Oh yeah.' And then he's like, he does this, he looks at me, 'That's right I kinda see it, but you kinda look like Tony Ferguson.'"<p>Watch the video below:</p><h2>Max Holloway next fight: Who will 'Blessed' fight next?</h2><p>'Blessed' returned to the octagon this past weekend against Arnold Allen at UFC Kansas City. Coming off a rather loopsided loss to Alexander Volkanovski, Holloway put on an impressive performance and proved that he is still a worthy contender.</p><p>Following a win over Arnold Allen, there has been a lot of speculation surrounding his future. Considering the fact that Holloway has won 12 straight non-title fights in the UFC, another title shot won't be undeserved. However, it looks like 'Blessed' wants to take on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-is-sponsored=false>someone else</a> before fighting for the title.</p><p>Speaking about his next fight during the post-fight press-conference at UFC Kansas City, Max Holloway suggested that he would like to face No.6-ranked contender Chan Sung Jung.</p>“Brother, brother. Korean Zombie, that’s the only guy from the - that is the only guy in my time with the older guys that didn’t get to fight. I would love that fight. There is a fight in my agent’s fricking country, Australia. Australia’s supposed to be happening sometime, we don’t know when. If Korean Zombie wants to get it, he can get it. He can get it.”<p>Watch the press conference below:</p><p class=article-p>Quick Links</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/staticg.sportskeeda.com/skm/assets/article/article-scroll-left.svg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/staticg.sportskeeda.com/skm/assets/article/article-scroll-right.svg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p>More from Sportskeeda</p>" modalPopup.closeOnEsc = false; modalPopup.setHeader("Why did you not like this content?"); modalPopup.setContentText(modalText); modalPopup.addCancelOkButton("Submit", resetRatingAndFeedbackForm, sendRating); modalPopup.removeCloseModalIcon(); modalPopup.disableDismissPopup(); modalPopup.open(); } else { sendRating(index); } } function sendRating() { var requestPayload = { "post_id": 1474006, "rating_value": ratingValue } if (ratingValue > 3) { requestPayload.rating_feedback_type = null; requestPayload.rating_feedback = null; } else { if (!$('input[name="drone"]:checked') || !$('input[name="drone"]:checked').value) { showErrorMessage('option'); return; } if (!$(".post-rating-feedback-note textarea") || !$(".post-rating-feedback-note textarea").value) { showErrorMessage('note'); return; } var selectedOption = $('input[name="drone"]:checked').value; var feedbackNote = $(".post-rating-feedback-note textarea").value; requestPayload.rating_feedback_type = selectedOption; requestPayload.rating_feedback = feedbackNote; } pureJSAjaxPost(addratingAPI, requestPayload, onsaveRatingSuccess, onsaveRatingFail, function() {}, true); } function resetRatingAndFeedbackForm() { var activeStars = Array.from($all('.rating span.rating-star.active')); for (var i=0; i &lt; activeStars.length; i++) { activeStars[i].classList.remove("active"); } if ($('input[name="drone"]:checked')) { $('input[name="drone"]:checked').checked = false; } var userNote = document.querySelector(".post-rating-feedback-note textarea"); userNote.value = ''; modalPopup.close(); } function onsaveRatingSuccess() { modalPopup.close(); savePostIdInUserRatedPostsCookie(); $("#post-rating-layout").classList.add("hidden"); $("#post-rating-message").classList.remove("hidden"); window.setInterval(function showMessage() { $("#post-rating-widget").classList.add("hidden"); }, 3000); } function onsaveRatingFail() { console.error('Saving post rating failed!'); modalPopup.close(); } function savePostIdInUserRatedPostsCookie() { userRatedPostIds.push(1474006); var expiryTime = new Date(); expiryTime.setMonth(expiryTime.getMonth() + 12); // Expiry after 1 year setCookie("user_rated_post_ids", JSON.stringify(userRatedPostIds), expiryTime); } function isPostRatedByUser() { var userRatedPostIds = getCookie('user_rated_post_ids'); if (userRatedPostIds) { try { userRatedPostIds = JSON.parse(userRatedPostIds); } catch (err) { console.error(err); return false; } } else { return false; } if(userRatedPostIds.indexOf(1474006) >= 0) { return true; } else { return false; } } function getRatingCountByPostId(postId) { return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) { pureJSAjaxGet( getRatingCountBaseURL + postId + '/rating/count', function(data) { try { data = JSON.parse(data); if (data.meta_value) { resolve(data.meta_value); } reject("Failed to fetch rating count for the post:" + postId); } catch (err) { reject("Failed to fetch rating count for the post:" + postId); } }, function(err) { reject("Failed to fetch rating count for the post:" + postId); }, true); }); } function showErrorMessage(messageType) { var messageContainerId = '#' + messageType + '-error'; $(messageContainerId).classList.remove('hidden'); window.setInterval(function () { $(messageContainerId).classList.add("hidden"); }, 5000); } (function() { var callFired = false; function lazyLoadPostRating() { if (callFired) return; callFired = true; if (!isPostRatedByUser()) { getRatingCountByPostId(1474006) .then(function(ratingCount) { if (ratingCount &lt; 10) { $("#post-rating-widget").classList.remove("hidden"); } }) .catch(function(err){ console.error(err); }); } } document.addEventListener("scroll", lazyLoadPostRating, { passive: true, once: true }); document.addEventListener("mousemove", lazyLoadPostRating, { passive: true, once: true }); document.addEventListener("touchmove", lazyLoadPostRating, { passive: true, once: true }); })();<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLzOq6uso5WasaJ6wqikaKWdlnyvsdasZKaZqGK1sLjLqK6asV2nsre10qKrrGWknrqmecaoq2abkaG5prCMraansV2bsrOz1Kymp2WcpLysrcuiop5llpa7br7EnKagppmvsg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./james-blunt-best-laid-plans-lyrics-meaning.html><span>←</span><span>James Blunt - Best Laid Plans Lyrics Meaning</span></a>
