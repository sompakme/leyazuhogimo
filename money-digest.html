Netflix likely will continue to exceed estimates the rest of this year thanks in part to continued growth in the DVD-rental-by-mail business, Piper Jaffray analyst Michael Olson said Monday as he moved his target on the stock from $36 to $40. By analyzing Web site data, Olson said he was able to deduce that visits to Netflix’s site rose 18% in the past three months, compared with a drop of 6% at Blockbuster’s Total Access DVD-rental site."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

By analyzing Web site data, Olson said he was able to deduce that visits to Netflix’s site rose 18% in the past three months, compared with a drop of 6% at Blockbuster’s Total Access DVD-rental site. Blockbuster’s fourth-quarter results — where it reported stagnant online subscription growth — showed “strength in Netflix’s improving market position,” he said. Netflix shares rose 5.3% on Monday to $38.17, while Blockbuster shares climbed 7.6% to $3.55.</p><p>Finance topper to leave EA</p><p>Electronic Arts said Monday that CFO Warren Jenson will leave the video game publisher, which is pursuing a hostile takeover of rival Take-Two Interactive Software. EA did not give a reason for his departure but said Jenson will stay to help the company close its fiscal year, which ends March 31, and could remain through September to ensure a smooth transition. A replacement hasn’t been named. EA took its $2 billion all-cash bid for Take-Two directly to stockholders this month. Take-Two has resisted the bid, saying it does not account for expectations of a blockbuster debut for its “Grand Theft Auto 4” game April 29.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8GuqqKmlajAcK7UrKCnnaOoeq%2Bx1qxmpqeemsZusMignKysXWZ9eISPbWY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./is-nature-stone-expensive.html><span>←</span><span>Is Nature Stone expensive?</span></a>
