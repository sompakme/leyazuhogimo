In his song, "Over H*es & B*tches," the former <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Migos</a> member suggests that Brown has <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">crashed out</a> over the actress, though it remains unclear whether or not she's ever actually dated Quavo. In the past, she's denied it, but fans continue to have their suspicions. Of course, the song has only added fuel to the rumors.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Recently, an unrelenting reporter caught up with Tran at an airport, asking her to share her thoughts on the feud between Quavo and Brown. She refused to say much, however, maintaining that <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">she didn't want to get involved</a>. “How do you feel knowing that you’re being dragged into a musical feud between these two?" the reporter asked her. “I don’t feel. It is what it is; I’m living my life," she responded simply.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-karrueche-tran-keeps-her-lips-sealed-on-quavo-amp-chris-brown-beef>Karrueche Tran Keeps Her Lips Sealed On Quavo & Chris Brown Beef</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Working, paying my bills, taking time for myself and that’s all that matters.

No comments,” she reiterated. “I just don’t want any parts, I want peace and happiness. I want to work and thrive.”</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">As for Tran's current relationship status, she says she's free as a bird. “I’m dating myself,&nbsp;actually,” she explained, calling herself “very happy” and <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">“very single.”</a> What do you think of Karrueche Tran's reaction to being inserted into Chris Brown and Quavo's feud?
