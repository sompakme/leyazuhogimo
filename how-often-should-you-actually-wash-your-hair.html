"One of the most common haircare myths I hear is that you shouldn’t wash your hair too often," the hair expert tells us. "However, from a trichologist’s point of view, this is not true. Cleanliness is key for keeping your hair healthy and your scalp balanced, and it's possible to wash your hair without stripping away its natural shine by using shampoo, conditioner and then a lotion to help nurture and strengthen the hair."</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h2 data-node-id=30 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Advice for medium hair</h2><p><h2 class="css-8ytyj0 e1bddzxd0">Philip Kingsley Moisture Balancing Shampoo</h2></p><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# aria-label="£48 at LookFantastic for Philip Kingsley Moisture Balancing Shampoo" data-href=https://www.lookfantastic.com/philip-kingsley-moisture-balancing-combination-shampoo-1000ml/10548047.html data-product-url=https://www.lookfantastic.com/philip-kingsley-moisture-balancing-combination-shampoo-1000ml/10548047.html data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=127X618962&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lookfantastic.com%2Fphilip-kingsley-moisture-balancing-combination-shampoo-1000ml%2F10548047.html" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-call-to-action="£48 at LookFantastic" data-vars-ga-media-role data-vars-ga-media-type="Single Product Embed" data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.lookfantastic.com/philip-kingsley-moisture-balancing-combination-shampoo-1000ml/10548047.html data-vars-ga-product-brand="Philip Kingsley" data-vars-ga-product-id=16c7a4ea-91bb-46bf-9cf3-eb62882fd328 data-vars-ga-product-price=£48.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=cfd8a701-4f1a-419b-be4c-1981cd9ade39 data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand="Philip Kingsley" data-vars-ga-product-sem3-category=Shampoos data-vars-ga-link-treatment="sale | (not set)" data-vars-ga-sku=lookfantastic_10548047 data-vars-ga-magento-tracking=1 class="product-image-link ebgq4gw0 e1b8bpvs0 css-15xslai e1c1bym14"><img alt="Philip Kingsley Moisture Balancing Shampoo" title="Philip Kingsley Moisture Balancing Shampoo" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vader-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/1585930384-10548047-2074686193647198.jpg width=960 height=960 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><h2 class="css-8ytyj0 e1bddzxd0">Philip Kingsley Moisture Balancing Shampoo</h2></p><p>Now 20% Off</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">If you hair isn't super fine you might feel like you can go longer without reaching for the shampoo, although the experts suggest looking to your environment before holding fast to a rigid schedule.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"You take your hair and scalp to the same places you take your face and they get just as dirty," argues the trichologist Anabel Kingsley.

It can also become drier and less easy to manage if over-washed.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=37 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">However, "I think not washing your hair is really bad in the long term," says the celebrity hairdresser and creative director of Virtue Labs, Adir Abergel. "You should wash your hair regularly to remove impurities and product build-up. And let’s not forget that your scalp is skin, and just like pores, product build-up can clog your hair follicles."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=38 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Women with Afro hair type 3A to 4C should routinely shampoo their hair every two weeks," advises the hairstylist Dionne Smith. "Afro hair types tend to be quite dry and even brittle at times and although our hair produces natural sebum we don't want to be stripping that out too frequently as it only makes the hair even dryer."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=39 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She adds that shampooing should, of course, vary for different individuals with coarse textured hair depending on lifestyle, "as if your a gym-goer, for instance, you may want to shampoo on a weekly basis, because sweat can build up in the hair, producing salt which clogs up the hair, pores and scalp". Leaving these impurities in "can go completely the other way and lead to breakage and damaged hair".</p><img alt="afro curly hair" title="Street Style : Paris Fashion Week Womenswear Spring/Summer 2019 : Day One" width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/models-imaan-hammam-and-cindy-bruna-are-seen-after-the-news-photo-1634572691.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h2 data-node-id=43 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Advice for sensitive scalps</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=44 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">If your main concern is a sore or flaky scalp, washing more often is scientifically proven to be a good thing, say the team behind Pantene. Frequent shampooing will help keep the scalp healthy (which is really important for hair health too), although choose a formula that is gentle and non-stripping to avoid irritation.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=45 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Many people, especially those with longer lengths, will only have dryness or damage towards the ends, with good condition at the roots," reveals Van Clarke. "It’s therefore generally best to choose a shampoo specifically to treat the scalp and root area. Then, choose your conditioner depending on your mid-lengths onwards."</p><h2 data-node-id=46 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">What happens if you wash your hair too much, or too little</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=47 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Similar problems can happen to your scalp as your face if you don’t wash it enough", explains Kingsley. "For instance, if you don’t cleanse your scalp frequently, excess oils, dirt, pollution and dead skin cells are allowed to build up. An accumulation of dead skin cells can cause itching and irritation – and visible flakes."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=48 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Fine, straight hair can also fall limp and develop a greasy shine (not a healthy-looking shine), and – according to Pantene: "Other hair types develop combination hair – greasy and matted on top, dry and tangled on the bottom," which can pose a unique challenge.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=49 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">And what if you over-wash your hair? While it might be unnecessary – depending on your hair type and lifestyle – the cleaning process itself might not actually damage your hair.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=50 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"The biggest risks to hair health is what happens to your hair while wet and the styling that is done after each wash," say the Pantene team. Hair is weakest when wet, so any manipulation (pulling, combing, etc.) can stress your hair. For those who use heat to dry and style their hair after washing, more washing means more heat exposure and more heat exposure means more damage. Opt for shampoos that can replenish your hair versus strip its nutrients and be sure to condition thoroughly with each wash to help prevent styling-related damage.<br></p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h2 data-node-id=52 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">How to properly wash your hair</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=53 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">If your hair feels constantly greasy or conversely dry, it might be down to the method you are using to clean your hair, more than its genetic texture.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=54 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I often wish the term ‘hair washing’ was changed to ‘scalp cleansing’ – as the aim of the game when you shampoo is to clean your scalp, which is a living tissue," reveals Kingsley.

There is no need to scrub your hair, and doing so can actually cause damage, tangles and breakage."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=55 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Follow Clarke's expert advice:</p><ul data-node-id=56 class="css-yzf9pi emevuu60"><li>Ensure the hair is completely wet before applying shampoo</li></ul><ul data-node-id=57 class="css-yzf9pi emevuu60"><li>Pour a teaspoon of shampoo and apply the thin film across the hair</li></ul><ul data-node-id=58 class="css-yzf9pi emevuu60"><li>Start to massage across the scalp paying particular attention to the nape and hairline which will tend to be dirtier</li></ul><ul data-node-id=59 class="css-yzf9pi emevuu60"><li>Use fingers to comb the hair between movements and keep the hair in line.
