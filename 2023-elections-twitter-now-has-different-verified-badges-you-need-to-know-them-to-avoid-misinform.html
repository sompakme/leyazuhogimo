However, with the introduction of Twitter Blue, that changed. The blue tick, which was once a mark of reverence, could now be accessed by anybody willing to pay a subscription fee of $8 for the Twitter Blue check mark.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/87f2e22ba6fac22e.jpg><p class=align-left>However, this new development aroused controversies and even led to a mass disinformation campaign that misled many. At the dawn of the new changes, an account paid for a blue tick and impersonated a pharmac*eutical company by tweeting false information, which later crashed their stock price.
